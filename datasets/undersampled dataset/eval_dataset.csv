"" while such a wording sounds rather modest , the actual implementation in his book , if viewed within the framework of his time , might very appropriately be called revolutionary . he broke with august schleicher 's distinction between 'd evelopment ' ( in prehistorical time ) and 'd ecay ' ( in historical time ) in the history of language and replaced it with his notion of continuous , uninterrupted development . his survey of the relevant literature of his time is almost exhaustive , and his findings serve as the solid stepping stone for his own advances . to facilitate reading , the editor has supplied an index of names ( with life dates ) , a complete listing of the literature referred to by scherer as well as an introduction to scherer 's life and his general scholarly achievements . towards a history of the basque language jose ignacio hualde , joseba a . lakarra & r . l . trask ( eds . ) 1995 365 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 131 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 585 0 price : us $ 90 . 00 rest of world : cloth : 90 272 3634 8 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com questions related to the origin and history of the basque language spark considerable interest , since it is the only surviving pre - indo - european language in western europe . however , until now , there was no readily available source in english providing answers to these questions or giving an overview of past and current research in this area . this book is intended to partly fill this void . the book contains both state-of - the-art papers which summarize our knowledge about particular areas of basque historical linguistics , and articles presenting new hypotheses and points of view based on hard evidence and careful analysis . all contributors to this volume have demonstrated expertise in the topic within basque historical linguistics that their chapter addresses . two classical articles by the late luis michelena are included in english translation . in addition , the book includes studies on diachronic phonology , morphology and syntax . the relation of basque to other languages is also investigated in a couple of chapters . english historical linguistics 1994 . papers from the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics ( 8 icehl , edinburgh , 19-23 september 1994 ) 1996 viii , 403 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 135 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 590 7 price : us $ 84 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 3639 9 price : hfl . 150 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com this volume offers a selection of 19 papers from those read at the 8th international conference on english historical linguistics . the topics discussed span the whole history of english from the common germanic period to the present century . the book also includes , as appropriate to the conference venue , a number of papers on the aspects of the historical development of scots and scottish english . historical pragmatics . pragmatic developments in the history of english andreas h . jucker ( ed . ) 1995 xvi , 624 pp . pragmatics & beyond new series , 35 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 328 9 price : us $ 97 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 5047 2 price : hfl . 170 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com until very recently , pragmatics has been restricted to the analysis of contemporary spoken language while historical linguistics has studied historical texts and language change in a decontextualized way . this has now radically changed and scholars from around the world are trying to build a new theoretical framework that integrates recent advances both in pragmatics and in historical linguistics . this volume , which contains 22 original titles , starts with an introduction that is both a state-of - the-art account of historical pragmatics and a programmatic statement of its future potential and its different subfields . part i contains seven pragmaphilological papers that deal with historical texts and their interpretations by paying close attention to the communicative context of these texts . the second and third parts comprise papers in diachronic pragmatics . the ten papers of part ii take a linguistic form as their starting point , e . g . particular lexical items or syntactic constructions , and study their pragmatic functions at different times ( diachronic form-to - function mappings ) , while the four papers of part iii take a particular pragmatic function as their starting point . e . g . discourse strategies or politeness , and study their linguistic realisation at different times ( diachronic function-to - form mappings ) . contributions by : c . allen ;

or can multimodal retrieval techniques be combined to create queries suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question is how can we create realistic queries for realistic systems . the third focus of this workshop is on evaluation techniques for multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using the standard evaluation measures defined for text documents ; these need to be extended / modified for multimedia documents . there is also a high degree of subjectivity involved that needs to be addressed . we will focus on the following specific topics : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource sharing here since annotating these , and coming up with a good query set are difficult participation : two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny at buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /",Safe Email
1710,"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.

buy them and the exact price to sell them.

*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns.

professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you

His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE

12346,"> Someone tell me a joke, or email me a beer or something...A man is out driving in the country, and drives past a farm with the most
beautiful pig -- fat, healthy, pink, clean, etc. Just a lovely pig. He gets
out to admire the pig, and notices that it has a wooden leg! The farmer
comes by and says ""Howdie"", and the passerby says ""I was just stopping to
admire your pig. What a lovely pig. But what's with the woo..."" The farmer
interrupts ""Oh, yes, this is the most wonderful pig! When our house had a
huge fire a few years back, and was burning down, this pig came in and
squealed and made sure we all woke up and got out. She really saved our
lives!"" ""My"", says the passerby, ""what a great story. But what's with the
wooden l..?"" The farmer jumps in again: ""And then, when my youngest was out
in the street playing just a few months ago, and a big tractor trailer came
barrelling down on her, this pig jumped right in and pushed her out of the
way, getting them both to the side of the road before the truck came by!""
""I'll say, that does show great bravery,"" said the passerby. ""But, if you
don't mind my asking, what *is* the deal with the wooden leg?"" The farmer
paused. ""Well,"" he said, ""a pig like that -- you don't want to eat it all at
once!""-- Sherry.

the food and other items they acquired from the Muslim vendors -- then
taunted them.That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting
light.  Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is
trying to starve them.It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of
activists.I'm rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.  Yet I find my sympathies
with the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train.

I think using a virus to compromise someone else's

605,"subcategorization in tranformational grammar dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol",Safe Email

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a "" no brainer "" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself !

yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 !

10925," I decided to try out GarGnome, to see what gnome2 looks like. It's
pretty, I'll give it that. However, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all
over the place, so I tryed out metacity - which doesn't have a GUI
configurator, and arsed if I'm going back to the fvwm days when you had to
set settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like. So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did
change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces. Any ideas what could have happened ? Would sawfish 2.0 silently change
the config files & break them?Kate

I've got these huge fish [12inchers currently but still growing].I know someone else with them too alonmg with a couple of cats, anyway one
day the cats sat on top of the tank waiting for the fish to do a swim-by and
they readied their paws for the kill. Trouble is the fish were also
interested in a feed and they were significantly faster than the cats. [They
could'nt actually hurt them as they only eat fish/very small rodents] in the
wild. But the cats got the fright of their lives and now they just sit
across the room from the fish warey of approaching the glass ;-)Personally I've been bitten many times, but only drew blood once so far.I wan't to thank all that replied to my totally OT mail, I never knew that
so many people were into our wee friends. CW-----------------

12735,"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own

to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk

classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.

to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach

that IDE has gone downhill since Andre Hedrick was

to have been unable to further development without

because they can't do any development themselves while
IDE is broken. Hopefully the 2.4 IDE port should help.

949,"> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human

life on Earth today.The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
an imperfect world.>  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does,

our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
taking share from every other government broadcaster.It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
they might.As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
how engaged we are in the world around us.Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
such a principle to be loosed upon the world.Rohit-----------------------------------------------------
September 20, 2002Full Text: Bush's National Security StrategyFollowing is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
the Administration's policy.INTRODUCTIONTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
against us.To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
turn.The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
trade, and cultural advancement.Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
drug cartels within their borders.The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
AIDS and other infectious diseases.In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
this great mission.I. Overview of America's International Strategy
""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
open societies on every continent.""
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
favors freedom.For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
equality.That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
with other states, and respect for human dignity.And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.To achieve these goals, the United States will:*	champion aspirations for human dignity;*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
attacks against us and our friends;*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
friends, with weapons of mass destruction;*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
free trade;*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
the infrastructure of democracy;*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
global power; and*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity
""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
different methods, but not different moralities.""President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
the secret police.America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
aspirations of their people.Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
cherish.Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
bodies.We will:*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
advance freedom;*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
to move toward a better future; and*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
it.III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
our choosing.""President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
unseen.Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
tools necessary to finish the task.The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
financial networks.However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
seek.We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) or their precursors;*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
harm against our people and our country; and*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
responsibilities.
We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
terrorism. This includes:*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
can condone or support and all must oppose;*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
on areas most at risk; and*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
attack.This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
and the private sector.This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
our allies can provide.As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terroristsIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts
""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
look so small.""President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
alleviate suffering and restore stability.No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
crises when they emerge.*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.
Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
apply these principles:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
for the creation of a Palestinian state.Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
that can help defuse military confrontation.Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
the entire hemisphere.Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
in our own country.In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
security to the Colombian people.In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
confronting these emerging transnational threats.Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
region:*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
and require focused attention;*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
operations; and*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
threats on a sustained basis.
Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
with Weapons of Mass Destruction
""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
we will oppose them with all our power.""President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
environment has undergone profound transformation.Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 
arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 
counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
inconceivable.But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
and dangerous.In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
attributes. These states:*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
for the personal gain of the rulers;*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;*	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
for which it stands.
At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
become a looming threat to all nations.We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
collection and analysis.Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
adversaries.*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
forward.*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.
It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
We cannot let our enemies strike first.*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
the wealth of their nations.*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
action.
For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
and delivered covertly and without warning.The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
and used weapons of mass destruction.The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
States will, if necessary, act preemptively.The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
remain idle while dangers gather.We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
actions. To support preemptive options, we will:*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
most dangerous threats; and*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.
The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
Free Trade.
""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""President Bush
Monterrey, Mexico
March 22, 2002A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
reinforces the habits of liberty.We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
growth, including:*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
improve incentives for work and investment;*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
endeavors;*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
efficient use;*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
opportunity.
The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
developing world.A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
global economic growth.Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
their future.We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
more effectively resolving them when they occur.The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 
became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
trade.*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
be our principal focal points.*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
Promotion Authority.*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria.*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
change and dynamism of open markets.*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 
between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
technologies.
Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
to:*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
international cooperation;*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
companies that can show real cuts;*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
reductions;*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
budget; and*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
better path.
VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
the Infrastructure of Democracy
""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
Development Bank)
March 14, 2002A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
U.S. international policy.Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
poorest economies within a decade.The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
achieve this goal:*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
that have not to implement reforms.*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
developing countries.*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
that these institutions do.*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
development projects that show results.*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
security strategy.*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
devastated by AIDS.*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.
VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
of Global Power
""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
of prepare for war.""President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
trade.The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
effective multinational fighting forces;*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 
and*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.
If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
friendships, we will:
*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
close defense and diplomatic cooperation;*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
the region over the longer-term;*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
environment; and*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
change in this dynamic region.
We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
into the Euro-Atlantic community.At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
decades.The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
future.The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
the only source of that greatness.The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
welfare of our citizens.Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
become routine and unproductive.Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 
the path of progress.IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century
""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
and enterprise of our people.""President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
September 20, 2001The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
transformed.It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
our military must:*	assure our allies and friends;*	dissuade future military competition;*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.
The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
challenges.The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
of U.S. forces.Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
infrastructure and assets in outer space.Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 
experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
United States.Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
targets.We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
to maximize injury.We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
information between intelligence and law enforcement.Initiatives in this area will include:*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
capabilities;*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
the nation and our allies;*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
sustain our intelligence advantage;*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
capabilities; and*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
government with all-source analysis.
As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
readiness to play our part.Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
and this is an area where America must excel.We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
personnel and officials.We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
the American people.Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
of it.In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 
such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 
our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 
skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 
our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 
entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 
energy. That is where our national security begins.

8939,"http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802BThe Disappearing Alliance
By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.At least, for now.Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday 
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac 
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat 
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, 
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where 
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past 
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I 
fry?As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the 
small stuff"". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to 
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't 
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that 
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the 
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM 
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, 
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a 
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning 
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only 
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running 
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The 
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How 
appropriate...See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656
Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have 
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card 
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the 
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe 
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from 
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based 
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just 
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their 
driver development has improved as much as their hardware 
seems to have.

Technical Censorship

Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time.

Yer Kidding... Really?
http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html
I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us 
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with 
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and 
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's 
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of 
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do 
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or 
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, 
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to 
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, 
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when 
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one 
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained 
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, 
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here 
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed 
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use 
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a 
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

The real question is: is there a way to run razor without this overhead?  
Even some sort of razord you could talk to over a unix socket would do.
Until I can find one, I cannot spare the resources to run razor at all :(-------------------------------------------------------

Mountains of Afghanistan is to send in the ASF (Alabama Special
Forces) Billy Bob, Bubba, Boo, Scooter, Cooter and Junior are being
sent in with the following information about the Taliban:1. There is no limit.
2. The season opened last weekend.
3. They taste just like chicken.
4. They hate beer, pickup trucks, country music, and Jesus.
5. Some are queer.
6. They don't like barbecue.And most importantly...7. They were responsible for Dale Earnhardt's death.We estimate it should be over in just about two days.

6717,"tei report , call for proposals the future of the tei report and final invitation for proposals 1 background information as reported on this list in early september , the text encoding initiative is considering options for its future organization and funding , and is actively exploring the possibility of a consortium or cooperative organization to support the maintenance and extension of the tei guidelines . on 3 - 4 october , the tei executive committee met with representatives of the tei 's sponsoring organizations ( ach , acl , and allc ) and of some prospective host institutions . the purpose of this note is - to report to the community on the steps being taken toward the goal of a new organization for the tei , - to outline for all concerned the current schedule of events leading toward a final decision , and - to reiterate the invitation for institutions interested in hosting a tei organization to contact the tei as soon as possible , in order to ensure that any proposals can receive full consideration . 2 issues list in the course of the meeting , we elaborated a list of issues which must be resolved in the course of any decision on the tei 's future organization and structure ; any proposal for organizing and hosting a tei structure is expected to address these questions . - intellectual property rights : the tei 's sponsoring organizations are taking steps to clarify the current status of rights in the tei ; any new structure needs to make clear how those rights are to be managed in the future . there is a strong conviction that in any new organizational structure the results of the tei 's work must remain publicly accessible , as they are now . - the governance and legal status of the proposed organization must be described . it is essential that the legal structure be one that allows full participation by institutions and individuals from all countries ; in particular , institutions in the european and north american countries where tei activity and use are currently most common should be on an equal footing . - proposals need to specify a plausible business plan and indicate the level of fees and other funding needed to make the proposed organization self-sustaining . the executive committee and sponsoring organizations have no particular requirements on this topic ( beyond the hope that membership fees not be prohibitively expensive ) ; prospective hosts must take into account the cultural differences between europe and america as regards fees for membership in consortia and cooperative organizations . - geography : there is a strong wish that the international flavor of the tei be maintained with regard to the membership , governance , and provision of service by a tei organization . - the tei has developed a structure and a set of procedures for organizing and carrying out the intellectual work of maintaining the guidelines ; proposals for the tei 's future need to specify in how far these procedures will be retained , and how they will be changed . - proposals for a tei organization should contain provisions describing what is to happen if the organization is unsuccessful ; such a fall-back plan should provide among other things for the reversion of the tei to the original sponsoring organizations . - the future role of the current sponsoring organizations in the future guidance of the tei must be spelled out . there is , in principle , a broad range of possibilities here ; in practice , the current sponsoring organizations wish to have some active role in the governance of the tei , at least for some initial period - - both in order to ensure continuity in the project and to demonstrate their continuing support for the tei and its goals . - the scope of the proposed organization or cooperative must also be clear - - where 's cope ' may be described in terms of discipline , or of type of activity , or of the common bases or foci of activities . the sponsoring organizations recognize that standards of many kinds may be relevant to the activities of their members , and they expect to continue collaborating with each other on standards of mutual concern . whatever institutional and organizational framework is set up for the tei must be in a position to collaborate flexibly with future initiatives of the sponsoring organizations ( as well as continuing the tei 's involvement in work on related standards like xml ) . 3 timetable the timetable for the decision about the future organization of the tei is as follows : 31 october 1998 : initial proposals should be received from prospective hosts . november 1998 : a review committee consisting of the tei executive committee and additional representatives from the sponsoring organizations will review and discuss the proposals and ask proposers for explanations and clarification of matters of detail in the proposals . 30 november 1998 : cut-off for the discussion process , and deadline for submission of revised proposals , with full institutional commitments . early to mid - december 1998 : a short list of proposals will be selected , and proposers will be notified and invited to give final presentations at a meeting in january 1999 . mid - january 1999 : meeting of review committee to receive final presentations , following which the sponsoring organizations will decide the future arrangements for the tei . 31 january 1999 : public announcement of the decision made by the sponsoring organizations will be made by the end of january . 4 invitation institutions interested in proposing to organize and host a tei organization ( or to make any other proposal for the future of the tei ) should contact the tei secretariat as soon as possible at the address below for further information , since initial proposals are expected at the end of october , and final proposals , including full institutional commitments , are due 30 november . members of the sponsoring organizations , or other users of the tei , who would like to express their views on any of the issues outlined above , or to suggest other issues that should be considered , are invited to comment on tei - l , or to contact the appropriate bodies within their association , or to write directly to the tei executive committee in care of the address below . - c . m . sperberg - mcqueen , university of illinois at chicago lou burnard , oxford university tei secretariat : c . m . sperberg - mcqueen , tei @ uic . edu",Safe Email

Be amazed - I've never bought anything online since an almighty cock up
with amazon dot con (that's not a typo) a few years back where I lost
all the dosh I'd paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
it been the UK branch I'd have had them in the small claims court
quicker than you could drop LOTR on your foot and say ""ouch"", but as it
was the US branch I'd just no comeback.

a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry . furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union . * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce . this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1 indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame . * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries . in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly . table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave . * * end * * follow above url for full report . come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids : strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 , 2001 !

trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.Bill

18243,"california update 8 / 28 / 2001 please feel free to address any california or western power questions / comments to g . britt whitman at ex : 54014 or kristin walsh at ex : 39510 . executive summary ? legislative maneuvering towards a bail - out plan mou developments the assembly energy costs and availability committee held hearings yesterday on the socal bailout plan , ab 82 . the chairman of the committee , rod wright , has agreed with hertzberg and davis to move something out of the committee , possibly by mid - week . much of the assembly ' s efforts to move along a comprehensive plan have been encumbered by the introduction of over 50 amendments . additionally , demonstrations by a group of farmers and resort owners opposing the conservation easement provision included in the bill may also slow the process . three central valley democrats ( reyes , flores and canciamilla ) on the assembly committee on energy costs and availability will likely be paying close attention to the demonstrations against the conservation easements , as farmers are significant in their districts . all three legislators face reelection . reyes has already signaled that , even though she voted for the bailout last time , she is disinclining to do so again . these three democrats may impede the progress of the bailout . there are strong indications that the plan will not come to a vote until it has the necessary votes to pass . at this point there still appears to be a lack of consensus on the democratic side . another substantive amendment to the current plan has been a call by socal for "" fair market value "" of its transmission assets , rather than book value . this value , of course , would have to be estimated and essentially means that even more money would have to go toward the bailout . while committee chairman wright would not oppose this idea , it will likely be hard for many of his colleagues to swallow , particularly on the senate side . once the amendments are disposed of and the bailout plan clears the assembly energy costs and availability committee , it will then go to assembly appropriations . the chair of this committee , carol migden , is friendly with both hertzberg and governor davis , so the plan appears unlikely to receive significant opposition in her committee . it will then go to the assembly floor for a vote . since it is likely some sort of bailout plan will pass the assembly , it likely will fall to the senate to decide ultimately if a socal bailout makes it to the governor or not . therefore , it becomes important to examine what deals might be made between burton and davis in order to get a bailout through the senate . for example , burton wants a change in the workers ' compensation laws to increase payouts to workers . this is a very important issue . on the one hand , both trial lawyers and the unions support burton . on the other hand , he is strongly opposed by the powerful ctma , the republicans and pro - business democrats , including governor davis . in fact , davis has already vetoed this legislation at least once and has promised to do so again . it is conceivable , though unlikely , that a deal could be struck whereby burton would allow a socal bailout to pass in exchange for davis signing workers ' compensation reform . however , if this were to happen , both the bailout and the workers ' comp reform together would be an enormous burden on california businesses at a time when these businesses are not doing well . this is why a deal on this particular topic appears unlikely at this time .",Safe Email

13142,"HelloYou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months

It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at
a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship.
You and your family could be lucky winners!

Date: Not supplied[IMG: http://www.konaweb.com/stick/left.jpg] I often carry my ukulele with me 
on planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great 
photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still 
need to carry around an amp, though. Link[1] Discuss[2] _(Thanks, Prentiss[3]!)

7756,"accents in classroom i received a number of helpful and informative responses from a few colleagues and i am grateful to all of them . below please find a digest of the responses . first of all , barbara partee provided the background information on the case itself , which was playing out practically in her own backyard . on july 7 , 1992 , barbara partee ( partee @ cs . umass . edu ) wrote to me : "" i ' m keeping an eye on the westfield accent uproar because it 's not far from here and there 's something about it in the paper almost every day , including editorials . i ' ll be glad to help keep you updated on news , and i would appreciate receiving any references you find out about to research that shows that the parents have nothing to worry about . ( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph "" linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good "" model "" in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . "" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades "" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . "" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city 's school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state 's secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal "" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . "" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as "" bovine scatology . "" the state 's attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state 's anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i ' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday 's nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , "" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . "" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there 's a great deal of debate about whether it 's racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? "" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : "" by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners ' request . i ' ll know more by this evening 's news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i ' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . "" the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners ' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners ' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : "" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . "" cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : "" of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher 's foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ? i grew up in several different places and my english has undergone a number of shifts - - i even had a japanese accent for a while . my english is quite native now and i do n't think that the different stages it went through did it any harm . . . . "" craig thiersch ( thiersch @ kub . nl ) : "" i ' m afraid i do n't have any citations from linguistics literature , and our phonologist is n't here today , but you ' re right : it 's more or less common knowledge that children virtually always acquire the accent of their peers , not that of parents , teachers , or other adults . i can think of countless examples from my own experience : for instance , i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the mid - west . but all their children had strong "" towny "" arlington accents . "" amy sheldon ( asheldon @ vx . acs . umn . edu ) : "" i was interested in learning that your daughter never acquired the pronunciations of the 3 adults at home , when they differed from , i assume , the local dialect . i can add that our 9 & 12 year olds do not have any of their father 's quebec french pronunciations or translations in their speech and on occasions when they have had his speech forms / usage , they seem to get rid of it when they learn the local dialect . that is , his speech does not persist in theirs . they also recently asked me if i thought that daddy had a foreign accent . they said they did n't think so . i must admit , that i have to stop and think a second before i realize that he does indeed have an accent , and that on reflection , our kids will admit to it too . but there is a sense in which we do n't think on a minute to minute basis of him as speaking differently from us , though certain pronunciations or translations on occasion may strike us noticeably . i 'd imagine that students in a class with a nonnative teacher muight have the same perceptions , esp . if the teacher is fluent in english , although having an accent . this is a good "" applied linguistics "" example . "" the only references that the discussion has yielded so far were contributed by catherine doughty and susan ervin - tripp . catherine doughty ( catherine . doughty @ linguistics . su . edu . au ) : "" the ability "" to be affected by phonology "" seems to be the earliest of thing to go in terms of maturational constraints on language acquisition - - see the work of johnson & newport 1989 in cognitive psychology 21 . j & n set the age of the beginning of the decline at 5 or 6 . another interesting case that is analogous in some ways but not others is the case of simon a profoundly deaf child of profoundly deaf parents . simon 's parents were late acquirers of asl ( learned at ages 16 & 15 ) and so provided non-native and very different versions of asl to their child . they are his only source of input , as simon goes to a "" normal "" school where no one knows any asl . simon 's asl is comparable to the asl of children who learn asl from native signers - - e . g . , nativelike . ( singleton 1989 dissertation ) . susan ervin - tripp ( ervin-tr @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : "" it would be nearly impossible for a child to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher unless it was the prestige accent of the community , and the child knew it . as labov showed convincingly , kids get their accents from their peers . on the other hand , i ran into some reported cases of children who preserved the accents of their immigrant parents , but these were unusual cases of socially isolated children . for example , in the clinical literature i found a case of an 8 year old who immigrated at 3 , and still had "" his father 's accent "" . as he was psychoanalyzed ( ! ) he lost his accent , spoke like his peers , and became able to mimic the accent at will . buxbaum , psychoanalytic quarterly , 18 , 279-289 ( 1949 ) .

7237,"Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train 
Ananova 
Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious."" To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:

systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far

5189,"Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?And to what event or events does it refer?I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*bc

We All
Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today's Society.
Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed.
Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:Monday: The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do?
Tuesday:  The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""What now,"" you think to yourself.
Wednesday: You've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?Â 
Thursday: Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven't a clue how to handle
    it.Â 
Friday:  Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?And what about all the other things:Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified?
Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair?
Lost a Security Deposit?
Bought a Home or Purchased A Car?
Signed an Employment Contract?
Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
Had Trouble With Your Credit Report?
Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute?
Been Involved in a separation or divorce?
Had to Collect Child Support?
Prepared A Will or Wanted To?
In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
 but it provides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
 and it is for a small monthly fee. No Kidding.  Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

""The marine biologists and geologists believe they have shown life could have existed by processing methane without the presence of oxygen. ""Their findings could also prove useful in ridding the earth of excess methane, one of the greenhouse gases many scientists believe is responsible for global warming. ""Traditional views of early life on earth centre on plants which converted carbon dioxide to oxygen. ""'These (plant lifeforms) date back to between three and 3.5 billion years ago... We have found biomass (large cluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show could have existed around four billion years ago,' Professor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told Reuters.Link: Yes, she exists.

( lantolf 's 75 - item list of references includes works by vera john - steiner , alexei leontiev , david olson , lev vygotsky , and other important authors usually neglected in l2 research . ) although few readers will find all of the papers of interest , every paper makes a contribution to our understanding of its topic , and taken together these volumes contain something worth the close attention of every conceivable reader in linguistics , developmental and experimental psycholinguistics , and second language theory and pedagogy . given the longstanding facts of 1 ) the prominence of spanish as a national language in the new world , 2 ) the preeminence of spanish as the first language of bilinguals in the us , and 3 ) the ubiquity ( and , more recently , the predominance ) of spanish and english as the languages studied in schools and colleges throughout the americas , spanish language acquisition and spanish - english child and adult bilingualism ought to be among the most common and well-supported areas of basic and applied psycholinguistic research . without going into the cultural , economic , and political factors that have held back such research , and that have pushed the study of spanish - english bilingualism almost entirely into the politically charged domain of ( mostly spanish - subtractive ) "" bilingual education "" , we can be grateful to p&g for bringing together an impressive array of high-quality studies that should stimulate many to pay more attention to these widely available sources of data on critical issues in l1 and l2 acquisition theory and in the psycholinguistics ( as opposed to the sociolinguistics ) of bilingualism . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ h stephen straight ( phd chicago 1972 ) , professor of anthropology and of linguistics , directs the programs in linguistics and in languages across the curriculum at binghamton university ( suny ) , where he has taught since 1970 . his research includes study of yucatec maya l1 acquisition , comparative sociolinguistics , translation theory , l2 pedagogy , multilingual education , and the role of the reception-expression dialectic in models of language and cognitive processes .",Safe Email

July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PTNO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and
partners.> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net
> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It
is all about interoperability and connection.So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit
Suisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.> How so?Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first
batch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual
Studio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel
good about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not
to say that other people aren't doing some reasonable bolt-on XML
support for the stuff they have.> You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and
> partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard
> for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within
the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction
and trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some
things I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have
increased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot
of the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the
fix, but sometimes we can't get the tools in their hands to deploy those
fixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and
there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We
are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.> Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to
> Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.No, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we
will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our
customers' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who
are pushing back really don't even know the new terms.> Isn't that your fault for not educating them?Yes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose
companies already have licenses, and they are saying, 'I think there's a
problem.' I don't deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some
issues we will have to work on over time.After July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was
talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would
be a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his
company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to
his company are now lower than they were before. And he said, 'Oh really?'So we'll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed
licenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger
concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be
some issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.> How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server
> developers work together? What we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the
company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of
the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, ï¿½ber-road map

> evolution of the solutions approach? I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions
stuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I
think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because
solution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of
the things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make
them into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What
will software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it
involves Windows, Office, and other applications.We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the
parts. That's not to say people are always comfortable with this. I
can't even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot
better than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step
forward for the customers.> Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars
> Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of
> a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.I would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come
together and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting
process here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of
input. [But] once it is decided, people don't get to vote with their feet.We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve
pulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do
that. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don't say
they want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, 'Ahhh, I get
it. That makes sense.'I don't want to go to six more meetings where people say, 'Is your
workflow strategy BizTalk?' ... Or 'What's your Office workflow
strategy?' Or 'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and
Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?'To get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level
road map to work -- you have to build something we don't have today. So
we have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get
all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you
just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand
flowers blooming.> In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors

question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn't
break down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we
have to have something interesting and innovative.People think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more
new product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems
integration so they don't have to get involved in that. So take
Sharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold
Team Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new
SKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down
level with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we
could do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put
things together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which
are then 'upgrades' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But
no matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to
convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than
the older idea we had.And there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given
product or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you
that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that
you will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of
this whole licensing discussion we are having.We moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we
wanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I
guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we
were. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning
the new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will
eventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated
over the years, and some people came to not understand it all.The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don't
want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do
have new ideas, it's like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that
one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have
access to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we
have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with
hitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the
customer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are
licensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.> That gets back to the trust issue, where if you front-load it, that's
> the big, lumpy upgrade; and if you back-load it with the vision, the
> .Net 2003 servers, you have a long gap in the middle where you have to
> sell into an untrusting audience.The truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you
can only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It's not like some
sort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the
storage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably
the shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going
to change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features
in PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.I think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to
deliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to
see that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is
lumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a
confidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,
our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.We know that, but we don't know exactly what that means yet. And this
whole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or
business discussion. It's how does software get rearchitected in the
world of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are
fundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the
anti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus
support in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows
Update. Now that's a small piece of software, but it is big. That's the
consumer market; we've got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.> The lack of broadband build-out and adoption seems to be holding up
> the ability for users to take advantage of some new services you're
> talking about. When Bill [Gates] invested in Comcast cable, it
> triggered the Baby Bells to get on board with DSL. What are you doing
> now to deal with that issue?The No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that
people will start saying, 'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.'> And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?Yes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was
not wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless
network available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I
don't know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I
don't know whose broadband I used. I didn't see it in Bill's room. I
called him up and said, 'Hey, come over to my room.' So soon everyone is
there and connecting to the Internet through my room.We have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General
Packet Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision
from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable
modems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not
many things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If
I am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you
can do things with speed that you otherwise can't do without speed, that
is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.That's the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn't it
awful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I
agree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,
there was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have
gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8
million [subscribers].> So how do we make that happen in this country?I think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the
consumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today's
prices or tomorrow's prices, that is going to shake out the
marketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just
have to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to
live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or
cable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]
Craig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off
of [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also
think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,
'Aren't we, too, some of that bottleneck?' We have not built software
that makes broadband a must-have.> Microsoft CEO weighs in

aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly
incompatible approaches [REST & SOAP] together.  I'll sketch it out
below, both in prescriptive form.  Note: while this is proscriptive, it
is expected that local adaptations will be provided.1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.
By persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical
life expectancy of days or greater.  Ensure that each instance has a
unique URL.  When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each
representation.  Unlike traditional object oriented programming
languages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there
will be a single representation of the entire instance.  These
representations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or
references) to other instances.3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,
update, and delete operations.  A key aspect of the design is that
messages for these operations need to be self contained - both the
sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of
assumptions as to the other's state, and multiple requests should not be
required to implement a single logical operation.  All requests should
provide the appearance of being executed atomically.4. Query operations deserve special consideration.  A general purpose
XML syntax should be provided in every case.  In addition, when a
reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a
relatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP
GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be
provided.Implications  The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from
the ""pure"" (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of
modifying multiple resources.  PUT and DELETE operations are rarely
used, if ever.  GETs may contain query arguments.2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change
the state of the recipient.  POST should be used instead.3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that
they identify the resource.  In particular, recognize that URLs can be
dynamically generated.  Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in
responses.  Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.
Allow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.  Use
HTTP GET for retrieval operations.Conclusions  Looking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols
that emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking
protocols of the next decade.  Both REST and SOAP contain features that
the others lack.  Most significantly:REST - SOAP = XLinkThe key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the
ability to link together resources.  SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress
in addressing this.  Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.SOAP - REST = Stored ProceduresLooking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some
key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.Finally, it bears repeating.  Just because a service is using HTTP GET,
doesn't mean that it is REST.  If you are encoding parameters on the
URL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving
the representation of a resource.  It is worth reading Roy Fielding's
 thoughts
on the subject.  The only exception to this rule that is routinely
condoned within the REST crowd is queries.  -- Sam Ruby, http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/07/20/restSoap.html

MR. AYANDA MAREDI
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.
Good morning,It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive
US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.May God's blessings be with you even as you reply.Regards,
MR. AYANDA MAREDI

solicited commercial email?I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that
really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent
SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the
two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple
identification of UCE.Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably
harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc
is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set
of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.Ross Vandegrift

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.  The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.Cheers,-James Rogers

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""",Safe Email

12419,"THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all"". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[This is the end of the media release. If you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=========================================================
=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME 
TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune.

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================
======= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
========================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
send 
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''.

======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised 
when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''.

So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for 
STATUS - i.e. I can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species, or I can  be ambitious, and 
go after the authority figure in the room.
The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of 
course, there's the ""they'll fuck anything  given
appropriate conditions."" Hmmm, is this a potential intelligence test, 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response?Owen

12276,"China's rapid economic growth, as ranked by the World Bank, is TEN TIMES 
FASTER than the world economy. The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, ""How can I 
participate in this explosion?"" We have the answer. Texas-based 
CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock 
China's amazing potential.INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITYTexas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) 
announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to 
China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of
high pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor
of its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:
they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.Opening China's DoorUsing hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say ""goodbye"" to 
the layers of middlemen.CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. *** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico. To SUBSCRIBE to the future communications, please click on this link and hit send:

Date: 2002-10-03T14:52:57-05:00So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like â€œyou 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devicesâ€? Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But â€œbecause it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devicesâ€ is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily
be the same as the backup disk.I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
for you though...Later,

18153,"more on human subjects a number of months ago i raised the issue of dealing with human subjects committees , since our department was being ( as we perceived it ) hassled by our own committee . i received numerous responses , which i have since forwarded to the lsa social issues ( or something ) committee . the responses varied from shocked outrage that anyone would look over our ( collective ) shoulders from shocked outrage that i would consider doing any research without asking permission . the primary hassle , which was reflected again in the more recent posting on the subject , is that linguistic research normally involves using a tape recorder . federal guidelines require ( so i am told ) a special , and more complex class of review if the data is being taped . in our case , this involves a full committee review , which takes two to three weeks , rather than the ` expedited ' review , which takes only a few days . we are still negotiating on whether class projects need to be cleared class by class ( which we hope ) or instead , student by student . given that students normally take at least half a semester to discover what they want to do , if it will then require an additional two or three weeks to get permission to do it , much linguistic classroom research may get halted . i would be greatly interested in hearing from people on the list who have been able to persuade their human subjects committees to issue any kind of ` blanket ' permission for certain kinds of research . when we suggested this possibility we were told that nobody 's research was privileged , and that if { sociology , psychology anthropology . . . } had to go through the process , so did we . in any case , as a result of my attempting to be law abiding , i almost lost an informant , whose data i had recorded illegally . i asked him to recite the nursery rhymes , then requested permission to do so . shortly afterwards , he left town , never to be seen again . sigh . . . any suggestions on getting expedited reviews , blanket permissions , other speeded up ways of being permitted to tape record linguistic data without supreme court approval would be appreciated . geoff nathan < ga3662 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > southern illinois university at carbondale",Safe Email

It is that last ""cutbuffer get"" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
just disable that - try this variant:proc Text_Selection {} {

4690,"referencing example numbers in wp since the question has been raised about how to reference example numbers in wordperfect for dos , here 's my two-cents ' worth about wp5 . 1 and wp6 for dos . in 5 . 1 , although one could use paragraph numbers , as was suggested , this precludes using them to number sections of a paper . a better approach is to use the numbering facilities for "" graphics boxes . "" like paragraph numbers , graphics boxes can be referenced by the cross-reference feature in wp . what you have to do is set equation box options so that the caption is to the left of the box ( the default is to the right ) . for phonological rules , which can be nicely formatted using the equation editor , you then create an equation box with a caption consisting of "" ( [ box number ] ) "" and go into the equation editor to write the rule . for sample sentences , etc . , the box itself is empty , but with a caption as before , and set to allow text to overlap it . you can then exit the create graphics box screen and proceed to type the examples . the numbers automatically update as new boxes are added . cross - referencing is done by assigning name to any example you want to reference ( as a cross-reference target ) and then putting in a cross-reference reference code with the target 's name . you have to generate occasionally to update the reference numbers ; they initially appear as ? . in wp6 ( which is superior for linguistics because of its support for phonetic symbols ) it 's even easier . wp6 has a counters feature ( in the character format dialog box ) . you define a counter ( i call mine example ) . whenever you want to insert an example , you type ( in the main document screen ) the open parenthesis , go into the counters dialog box , and push f8 ( or click on the increment and display button ) . this inserts two codes : one to increment the number ( this is not done automatically for user-defined counters ) and one to display it . cross - referencing is done as before . a couple of additional wp tips : - the styles feature is very useful for dealing with in-text stylesheets for journals . for any feature where journals have different styles ( scare quotes , sentence glosses and translations , in-text reference punctuation , etc . ) you assign a style . styles can be any combination of characters and codes . for each journal , you create a different style library . then , if you want to change formatting from one to another , you simply read in a different style library . - the above is too simple for bibliography style sheets , where the order of elements differs in addition to punctuation and font attribute . if you are comfortable with programming , you can write merge programs ( called primary merge files in wp5 . 1 and merge form files in wp6 ) for the different stylesheets and have a bibliography file which is formatted as a secondary merge file ( wp5 . 1 ) / merge data file ( wp6 ) , with fields for things like author 's first and last names , year , title , etc . ( include a field for type of reference ( book , article , dissertation , etc . ) since the format of the title may vary . ) this is not recommended for computerphobes , however . - lining up foreign language examples with word-for - word glosses in proportional fonts can be done using tabs , and resetting the tab stops for each example . this is easier from wp6 . 0b onwards ( if you have a mouse ) because of the ruler feature : you display the ruler and drag the tab stops , and as you drag them a dotted line extends down from the tab stop through the text so you can see exactly where you are . in previous versions , you have to go into the tab set menu and play with the tab settings by trial and error . it is even possible to put asterisks inside the space of the tab between the example number and the example . instead of tabbing , use the tab align ( wp5 . 1 ) or decimal align ( wp6 ) feature ( ctrl f6 ) . before pressing ctrl - f6 , set the "" decimal character "" to the first letter of the example ( on the other format menu in 5 . 1 and the character format menu in 6 ) . to prevent the spell-checker from stopping on words in foreign examples ( or phonetic representations , or logical formulae ) , in 5 . 1 you can use the language feature to insert a made-up language code . the spell-checker will complain that it can't find the dictionary for the language , and you tell it to ignore the language and continue checking what it can . in wp6 a block can be marked [ speller / grammatik off ] ( on the other format menu ) to prevent it from being spell - or grammar-checked . - - yehuda n . falk department of english the hebrew university of jerusalem "" live long and prosper "" - vulcan greeting",Safe Email

I'm sure this is common knowledge already, but just in case ...http://security.tombom.co.uk/shatter.html   This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft
   Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The
   flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,
   unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires
   functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on
   the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has
   known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this
   attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -
   the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments
   made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there
   were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national
   security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He
   mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,
   given the quantity of research currently taking place around the
   world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat
   community saw what is actually possible.

1719,"FYI, members of this list might be interested in the 4th International
Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in
Montreal, Canada.http://star.itc.it/wse2002/- Jim>>From the Web page: The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is
becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static
information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards
and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing
Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the
range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web
design, software engineering, and information technology communities to
discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and
tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and
experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing
platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and
Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation
of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the
Web.WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related
to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not
limited to):*   Migrating to Web services
*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product
control
*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable
*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure
*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple
platforms
*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as
architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites
*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolutionWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software
Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event
focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of
""maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems"" nicely compliments WSE
2002's overall theme and goals.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

( press release 10 / 11 / 2004 businesswire ) thats 4 vessels already , and more news is likely to be released in the coming weeks . all this sets the stage for a move onto otcbbwhich is precisely where company chairman and ceo , will riner , sr . , is ready to take isyj . from there , the breakout could unfold at a skyrocketing pace ! a $ 1 share price by july 2005 ? invest in isyj now , youll be in at around . 20 a share , just preceding the time when next yearsinvestors could be clamoring for shares at $ 1 or more ! t he independent investment advisor the research works projected isyj to trade at $ 1 . 05 by july 2005 . from their report : management has suggested that the silversea contract is the company ' s model for the future . as in - systcom negotiates with other cruise lines representing 40 ships and 32 , 000 cabins , the company expects to gross approximately $ 15 weekly per cabin in revenue as it expands . expanding on those revenue figures yields stunning numbers . in north america alone , 215 , 000 cruise ship cabins ( berths ) represents a total potential market for isyj of $ 167 . 7 million a year ! in - systcoms very reasonable growth strategy , which has been updated to 50 ships over 18 to 24 months , projects to revenues of $ 31 . 2 million a year in 2006 ! and at the current netprofitability of around 31 % of gross revenue , that projects to about 17 eps ! with aggressive growth companies typically trading at 30 to 40 times earnings , isyj could reasonably be a $ 6 to $ 7 stock in 24 months ! longer term , perhaps 24 to 36 months , isyj has all the potential to be a $ 7 to $ 10 stockthats 2 , 800 % to 4 , 000 % growth from todays share price offering investors right now the potential to start small with minimal risk and hit the jackpot ! just $ 2 , 000 invested today could return $ 54 , 000 to $ 78 , 000 in pure profit ! this is the kind of opportunity that could make your dreams come true . and the best part is , the technology is already installed and serving thousands of passengers right now . its just waiting to grow as more and more ships are outfitted with the in - systcom sealynx system ! on the current installation schedule , isyj profits could be com ing on fast . according to projections provided by ceo , wil riner , in - systcom could reach first profitability as early as 2 nd quarter 2005 ! companies on the pink sheets fantasize about the day when they may see revenues , let alone those that turn a profit ! yet in - systcom is projecting profits just a few months from now ! whats more , the current installations are working as planned and revenues are beginning to flow that make profits in q 2 / 05 a very real probability . thus , this is one of those pivotal moments in a companys life that marks a turning point for investors . do you invest nowor do you wait and miss the explosive price surge coming out of pink sheet valuations ? if youre an aggressive investor , the answer should be clear . at todays share price , this could be one of the very best investment decisions you make . even if you limited yourself to just a few thousand shares , you could turn a handsome profit in just a few months , with a very modest downside risk . whats more , by buying now , youll be setting the stage for a major breakout in the future and a fat profit to pad your position ! not a pipe dream . not an rd promise . its real , onboard , and happening now ! since the in - systcom is already operational on a number of ships , serving tens of thousands of passengers , you dont have to wait for the sales department to prove that theres a market either ! new orders should be coming in very quickly . especially as cruise lines see the capabilities of their competitors grow . rather than looking for customers , in - systcom could be faced with the enviable problem of having them line up at the door ! competition ? not any time soon ! this is a fantasy island of profit opportunity ! youll love this part of the show right now , theres no competition to the in - systcom technology ! its the only show in town ! if a cruise line wants internet connections to the cabins , it has two choices . dry dock and retrofit , or choose in - systcom to interface with their existing systems . the growing market and only one source for a sensible solution ! according to more cruise industry statistics , about 87 % ( 8 . 3 million passengers ) of cruise ship passengers boarded north american cruise ships . you know what that means , a whole city full of americans with no personal access to the internet , even for e - mail ! these are people who write big checks for first class service . its reasonable to think that the vast majority of them live by e - mail at home and at work . and since most cruises last more than a week , internet access could be a make - or - break point about booking a cruise . whats more , the problem is getting worse . since the year 2000 , the cruise industr y has grown from 5 . 1 million passengers to 9 . 5 million . by 2010 , the figures are expected to soar past 17 million passengers ! and youre going to deny these people access to the internet ? since most cruise ships were built years ago with wiring that did not anticipate a modern internet , the cruise operators have had nothing to offer except on - board public internet lounges . that just doesnt cut it in 2005 ! the in - systcom solution puts the internet into every cabin on board ! live sports shows and movies too ! from marketing perspective , this could be the right product at the right time for a growing industry . once a cruise company makes the commitment to upgrade to in - cabin internet , e - mail and interactive services , in - systcom can have a fully operational system up and running in a matter of weeks , with no downtime and no disruption to normal cruise activities . in - systcoms technology breakthrough came when it developed an interface that linked the existing phone wiring with the ships c - band or k - band com links . these com links provide the uplink and downlink needed to enable internet and satellite tv access while the in - systcom sealynx system manages the bandwidth possible on the room - to - room wiring network . as reported by in - systcom management , nobody else has this technology nor anything like it . whats more , in - systcom is not just targeting the cruise ship industry ! the resorts at cruise ship destinations face the same dilemmas . high - end resorts on remote is lands face similar challenges providing guests with access to online entertainment , movies and sports programming that their american guests have come to expect . using in - systcom technology , resorts could soon offer a complete menu of in - room entertainment , including internet access and e - mail . that market adds millions more travelers to in - systcoms potential revenue equation . invest now in isyj and you could sit back and relax on a profit - making cruise of a lifetime . and , you can expect your investment will be well managed because even though in - systcom is a relatively new company in - systcom is commanded by a seasoned crew of technology and cruise industry veterans . with veterans like this at the helm , you can be certain your investment will stay true to an aggressive growth course . wil riner , sr . , chairman / ceo / director , has more than 30 years of experience , both domestic and international , in marketing , product development and telecommunications . in 1983 , he received a u . s . patent for the first integrated personal computer workstation featuring a multi - line business phone and multi - tasking capability . in 1986 , mr . riner founded the network connection inc . ( nasdaq : tncx ) , a designer of computer servers and interactive , broadband information and entertainment systems . in 1999 , he helped orchestrate the companys merger with in - flight technologies , then moved on to create in - syst . com inc . , in january 2000 . peter demilio , president , is a former manager of marine technologies for carnival cruise lines , where he m anaged the development and installation of interactive television systems , internet cafes , advanced broadcast television , and satellite telecommunications services . he also owned a technology company devoted to computer graphics , video presentation , and interactive communications . hes also a member of the federal communications advisory committee on the future of interactive telecommunication technology within the maritime industry . wil riner , jr . , vp engineering / director is the former director of sales and marketing of tnci atlanta where he developed domestic and international distribution of the company ' s lines of video server products used in training and entertainment . in 1998 , tnci became the first company ever to install an faa certified digital seat back entertainment system aboard a commercial aircraft . mr . riners other project includes th e sale of shipboard in - cabin digital entertainment system for carnival ' s 900 cabin sensation and carnivals 1200 cabin flag ship triumph ! . stephen stethers , vice president / secretary and a director has more than 15 years experience in the personal computer and network server industries . he is the former vp of operations and project manager for the network connection inc . ( tncx ) , responsible for overall project management and installation of the cruiseview video on demand system isolating dedicated channels for in - house services . mr . stethers has completed projects aboard two cruise ships ( star cruises , malaysia ; carnival cruises , florida ) . what you should do now to lock in this opportunity . at the time of thi s writing , isyj has been trading at $ 0 . 20 per share , so this is the ideal opportunity to lock in a solid position with a small investment . because of isyjs aggressive growth plan is progressing now , you could see rapid share price gains in the coming weeks as news of isyjs accomplishments is announced and investor interest grows . it is reasonable that the current share price represents the very best entry point for new inv estors . however , as can be expected , this is a risky investment suitable only for aggressive investors willing to assume the risk of substantial losses . considering the current state of isyjs growing business and very low price per share , a significant position in the company can be taken n ow putting just a modest investment at risk . 400 % near - term share price growth projectioncompany : in - systcom , inc . ticker : isyj ! near - term projection : $ 0 . 80 $ 1 . 00 growth : 400 % / 6 months 2 , 800 % + / 12 - 24 months * * analysis provided in this report . watch for news due out very soon that could send share prices up in a sharp immediate spike of 30 % to 50 % ! view or chang e your preferences legal disclosure",Phishing Email

10135,"Well, I tried the Ximian GNOME 2.0 packages from
http://apt.sunnmore.net, and have to say, it was a let-down.  Ran
'apt-get update' , 'apt-get install gnome-session' then 'apt-get
upgrade' and Nautilus failed to execute, couldn't get any help docs to
come up, along with more problems.  So, with the luck of 'rpm -qa|grep
ximian' then removing by hand all ximian packages with 'rpm -e --nodeps'
and reinstalling everything GNOME and GNOME-related with apt, I got
trusty old Red Hat 7.3 GNOME back on the desktop, and the only trace of
Ximian is Evolution, again, thanks to apt from this site.I really liked Ximian (back then, Helix ?) at first but, to me, Red
Hat's GNOME, released with 7.3 seems much more pretty and up-to-date. 
Could this be because of inclusion of gtk2 in RH 7.3?Lance  On Fri, 2002-07-26 at 07:40, MichÃ¨l Alexandre Salim wrote:

3905,"Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.Cheers,

Â  07.16.2002 GnomeREPORT Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still
getting record downloads for our first
FREE Gnometome. What does
that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make
more. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services
a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who
couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your
data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you
get featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls
to its knees. We're still sitting
at #5 on Amazon. If we ever
hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get
from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: ""Do you care to Super Size that?""
You can respond, with dignity: ""My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me
earlier."" It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't
going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will?Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph
I like to call: ""Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL."" They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!"" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. It's my ""direct"" way of saying: you're
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people
from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more
junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate?My good buddy, Bill,
tells me that Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: ""Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!"" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: ""Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period."" All the more fries
for me, dude!

{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then ""forget
about it."" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information."" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.
Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/
{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from ""Chris"" to
""Caspian Wildflowers""...)Recommend It!

Disk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html
{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
    Unearthed by Michael Tretyakovhttp://www.actualtools.com/
{Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons."" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On Top"" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
""important"" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize To Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you don't have to close down your programs to do
it.

{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless!Recommend It!
Â GnomeTIPI just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =
Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log
files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your
registry before making any modifications.

"" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . "" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . "" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

collins : well , any time that a company goes through a short term period of troubles , the industry surrounding that , that has an intricate layer of credit relationships , is concerned about their ability to be paid . haffenreffer : but for people who don ` t know what enron does , what role do they play in the trading of natural gas futures ? collins : well , they are a major counter - party in the natural gas industry in trading , selling and distributing natural gas . and so , they have an extensive network of credit relationship with virtually every natural gas company in the north american industry . haffenreffer : are they involved , in some way , with almost every trade having to do with natural gas ? are they that big ? collins : no . i wouldn ` t say that they ` re involved with every trade . they ` re involved in a substantial amount of trading through their electronic market making system . but , no , they ` re only a component of the market , and only do , perhaps , a percentage of what trades on the nymex . haffenreffer : so when trading takes place , and it ` s very fast , there ` s a lot of money changing hands all the time . there ` s a lot of credit given to people trading and when a company like enron has got some liquidity problems , or just even fears of liquidity problems , that can affect people who do trades with them . collins : yes . absolutely . it can cause people to retract from trading . it can cause disruptions in the natural flow of trading . it ` s not unlike the financial markets at all . when you have a serious credit concern . haffenreffer : as result , the nymex is working at a faster clip to get a clearing service set up . is that right ?

"" we have to wait for the reaction of the four companies to see if they will change their accounting system so that they do not hinder other competitiors , "" cartel office spokesman stefan siebert told reuters . "" if they don ' t do that , then ultimately we could issue an injunction to force them to do so . "" the competition authority said earlier in a statement it had received complaints that grid operators bewag ( bklg . de , enbw , hew and veag that the four firms "" charge their competitors unreasonable and partly fictitious costs "" for balancing energy . german grid operators have sole control over the purchase and sale of such power in their grid areas , which they control by temporarily switching on and off their power plants . this poses a potential threat to other power suppliers . "" new entrants to the german market , such as london ' s enron capital & resources and hamburg ' s lichtblick , because of their small customer portfolios , cannot balance unplanned amounts of power withdrawn as well as the big utilitiy groups can , "" the statement said . "" consequently they have a greater need for balancing energy ( and ) are threatened with the considerable burden of unreasonable prices for it . "" the four utilities have argued that the accounting system they use for balancing energy corresponds to guidelines in the country ' s association agreement ( vv 2 ) , which is due to be modified by next year . "" illegal cartel conduct cannot be justified through the association agreement , "" said cartel office president ulf boege in the statement . "" references to the agreement show rather that there is an urgent need for action in vv 2 , which is currently being modified , to develop regulations on the accounting of balancing energy that conform with cartel law , "" he added . utilities rwe and e . on have introduced an auction system for their balancing energy needs to provide a market to other potential generators , as a condition of their respective mergers last year . rwe net ' s regulating power manager klaus albers said last week that the system it introduced in april , which is based on a cartel office model , had not so far produced the lower prices it was designed to . he said he expected all grid operators to introduce a market for their balancing energy needs within two years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",Safe Email

16207,"ellipsis in conjunction call for papers , focus group , zas , berlin , oct . 2 - 3 , 1998 workshop on ellipsis in conjunction in view of the growing interest in conjunction ellipsis this workshop is an attempt to promote the communication and bridge the gaps between different approaches within the framework of generative syntax . the workshop will concentrate on the following issues : ( 1 ) the structure of a conjunction construction . is the base-generated structure of a coordinate construction a double-headed structure ( williams 1994 ) , or does it have the second conjunct right-adjoined to the first conjunct ( reinhart 1991 ) , or is it a projection of a conjunction word ( &p ) ( munn1987 ) , or something else ? ( 2 ) the possible categories to be conjoined . must a conjunct be a clause or an extended projection ( excluding smaller xp - types ) ? must a conjunct be an xp ( excluding head and x ' ) ? and how are ' asymmetrical coordinations ' analyzed if only ' like ' categories can be conjoined ? ( 3 ) the analyses of ellipsis and gapping constructions . the verb gapping construction , for instance , has been analyzed as rightward np movement followed by an identical constituent deletion ( jayaseelan 1990 ) , across - the - board verb movement ( johnson 1996 ) , and deletion licensed in lf ( wilder 1997 ) . in addition , it remains to be shown how to account for the relationships between vp ellipsis , pseudogapping and gapping . furthermore , a general study of sluicing is required to cover wh in-situ languages where slucing does not alternate with an overt movement to eliminate strong features of a wh question ( lasnik 1997 ) . ( 4 ) the analysis of similarities and differences among various types of reduction . how and why do coordinative , comparative , and exception conjunction ellipses share properties and differ from each other syntactically , and / or semantically ? are the properties of forwad deletion and backward deletion related to lf and pf respectively , as claimed by wilder ( 1997 ) ? ( 5 ) the constraints on the ellipsis constructions . what are the language-specific properties that might interact with the representations of conjunction ellipsis ? are there any ellipsis or gapping rules in ug ? ( 6 ) the connection between conjunction ellipsis and information structure . to what extent are such ellipses determined by information structural aspects like focus background structuring ? ( 7 ) studies of conjunction ellipsis of a greater variety of languages . invited speakers : danny fox tilman hoehle kyle johnson jason merchant alan munn craig thiersch chris wilder organizers : kerstin schwabe , niina zhang , horst - dieter gasde , and andre meinunger the deadline for receipt of abstracts is july 1 , 1998 . please send your abstract ( 1 a4 / letter - size max ) to : dr . niina zhang zas jaegerstr . 10-11 10117 berlin germany tel : 49-30 - 20192572 fax : 49-30 - 20192402 email : ellipsis @ zas . gwz-berlin . de we accept abstracts by fax , email , as well as regular mail . the selection of the abstracts for presentation will be finished by the end of august . zentrum fur allgemeine sprachwissenschaft ( zas ) http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de",Safe Email

did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
initial SOA problems. I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)Regards...jmcc

12054,"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=4816872.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resortHolidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence

It was a fine tool, better than any other I've had to use...)The Bug Count Also Rises
by John Browne
(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves 
of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles 
drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then 
later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles 
and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came 
to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were 
not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in 
Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you 
thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the 
floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they 
ate at you.When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge 
with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite.""""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.""""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was 
greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado.""""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.""Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in 
Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.""""Herb tea?""""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his 
office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for 
awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me.""Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said.""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.""""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live 
quietly.""""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only 
drink herb tea.""""Herb tea?"" Michaels said.""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully.Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I 
will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for 
the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time 
Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them 
with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all 
the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.""Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they 
walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried 
the bodies back from the meetings.--

might want to point out to other Gnomies that they could 
practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot 
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for 
more than 1100 songs available on the site and by 
downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they 
can even change the key of the song to suit their voice 
range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their 
taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they 
would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no 
extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to 
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly 
prepared for your Karaoke.""Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to 
help out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server 
and networking stuff. The tough part is remembering 
everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, 
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks 
in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a 
handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that 
I left something important behind. What will it be this 
time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.

Forwarding to Internet Address Fails
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636
Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all 
internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out 
of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of 
cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along 
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was 
the driving force behind this request. What I found was that 
Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding 
rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent 
out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to 
be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a 
default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that 
prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the 
Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick 
configuration change and restart of IMS will put things 
right.

... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to 
the greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 
indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud 
the move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously 
identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the 
service pack will be put on ice until the issues are 
straightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job, 
Microsoft.

Windows XP System File Checker
Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a 
possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under 
Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to 
attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no 
improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case 
you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're 
probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that 
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or 
altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable 
state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, 
and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any 
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left 
in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is 
used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has 
been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command 
prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options.

Consider This
Forwarded by JWhttp://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html
The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected 
representatives, you might want to start asking about their 
opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and 
right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain 
death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz 
Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman 
gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack 
into your systems without proof of provocation in order to 
ensure that you are using their software according to the 
stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or 
upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in 
return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is 
seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, 
consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly 
pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software 
and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the 
authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was 
eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more 
right.

15452,"Hello JustinThe simplest setup would be to connect a wireless access point to you
hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop.  You could
also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for
your desktop machines.The access point would be configured with a network name (essid) and a
channel number for you wireless network.  The client machine would be
configured with the same network name, it should be able to auto detect
the channel number.Driver support is very good, there are only a few wireless chipsets,
and I believe that all but the newest 802.11b Plus (22Mbps) and 802.11a
hardware has Linux drivers.If you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at

Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
programming syntax
to make sure people use loops or recursion?
<>Kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be 'good'.
For example people bang on about polymorphism, but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance?Hmm.I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

10008,"california power 2 / 8 please contact kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) or robert johnston ( x 39934 ) for further clarification . executive summary : utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles - agreement on payback for the bailout , rate increases , and further short - term funding for dwr purchases of power . disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities . the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets . the economics of the long - term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period . air quality management district regulations are under review , but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity . legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left - wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow , if not stop , davis ' s bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton ' s eminent domain threats against generators , which reflect this pressure , are of little significance . 1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state , the utilities , and their creditors , with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday . socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard to keep cash on - hand , and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs , they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy . opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely , but that everything will be resolved during that 50 - day period . senator john burton "" is in no hurry "" to reach a deal with the utilities , as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to "" strong - arm "" the utilities . burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated , "" bankruptcy would be bad , but not the worst thing possible . "" he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities . still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on : what the state receives in return for the bailout the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday ) additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may . there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend . additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund . 2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants . no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer . 3 . long - term contracts as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years . assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "" tablet from on high "" from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 . these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line . according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary . 4 . air quality district exemptions there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government . currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow "" dirtier "" plants to come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) . 5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout . 6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable . 7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash . ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .",Safe Email

completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes ""sooper secret"" methodologies to
determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
something becomes spam at some level of ""confidence.""The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

much yet, but it's there.If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)
PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and
currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your 
session to get killed by the proxy.  Netcat send keepalives
which prevent this :)#

course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be

 CNETÂ TECH982.84 Â -24.59Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88 percent, to close at 1,356.95.Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.
AOL used unconventional business practices-Post 
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post reported on Thursday.A chart printed in conjunction with the Post article shows a total of $270.1 million in unconventional deals.AOL TIME WARNER INC 12.45 -5.03% IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits 
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 72.05 1.92% Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2 
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third quarter versus the April-June period.""it will be a reasonable quarter, but it will not represent such a dramatic growth as what might have been seen in some previous years,"" Chief Executive Jorma Ollila told a conference call following the firm's second-quarter result.NOKIA CORP ADS 13.33 -5.59%

J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02 
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a ""market performer"" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTL INC 2.74 14.64%

3098,"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.

11843,"syntax wesley hudson . pragmatic constraints on binding into noun phrases . ph . d . diss . u . s . c . distr . by gsil publications ( gsil @ usc . edu ) this study analyzes a set of constructions referred to as specificity effects , where the possibility of extracting from within or binding into a noun phrase depends on non-syntactic properties of the np . in contrast to a number of syntactic studies of this phenomenon ( fiengo and higginbotham ( 1981 ) , bower ( 1987 ) , diesing ( 1990 ) ) , this work argues for a non-syntactic analysis of specificity effects . thus the inability to quantify into specific nps follows from a pragmatic equivalent to structurally determined wide scope readings . the class of nps which induce such wide scope readings is defined in terms of two distinct pragmatic properties . the first is referentiality as defined in burge ( 1974 ) , where the interpretations of referential nps are relativized to acts of reference performed on particular occasion of utterance . the second property is based on hawkins ( 1991 ) 's approach to anaphora with ( in ) definite nps ' and involves the implicatures speakers utilize in conveying whether or not a referent is identifiable . these pragmatic properties are shown to correlate with the opacity of nps more closely than syntactic or semantic properties . gsil pulbications patricia schneider - zioga . the syntax of clitic doubling in modern greek . 1994 in this dissertation it is argued that clitic doubling involves a predication structure where a clitic left dislocated ( cllded ) expression , which is a copy of the clitic doubled expression , is the subject of the predication and the clitic and doubled expression serve as the predicate variable ( cf . iatridou ( 1991 ) for clld ) : ( a ) noun phrasej [ predicate . . . cliticj - v noun phrasej . . . ] either the cllded or the doubled argument may phonetically delete . the difference between clitic doubling and clld is a matter of whether the topic or the doubled expression is phonetically ( but not syntactically ) deleted . this proposal accounts for what kind of lexical projections allow clitic - doubling ; the difference in behavior between accusative and oblique clitic doubled expressions ; the impossibility of doubling qps that contain expressions needing antecedents and other reconstruction effects ; as well as the scope interpretation of doubled qps . assymetries between clitic doubling and clld are also addressed . for more information , please contact : gsil @ usc . edu liliane haegeman , the syntax of sentential negation . 1993 / 94 ca . 250pp . paperbound approx . usd 50 rosenberg & sellier via andrea doria 14 , i-10123 torino ( credit card accepted ) this collection comprises papers by : l . haegeman , n . duffield , i . laka , j . ouhalla , e . pearce , l . progovac , g . puskas , m - l . rivero and r . zanuttini . it appears in two successive issues of "" rivista di linguistica "" : 5 , 2 ( 1993 ) and 6 , 1 ( 1994 ) ; the second one will be available very soon . an obvious alternative to the separate purchase of these issues is the subscription to the journal . | | | | - - - - pier marco bertinetto scuola normale superiore / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - tel . + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 509111 p . za dei cavalieri 7 / / / / / / / - - - - - - - fax : + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 563513 i-56126 pisa / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - history of ling murray , stephen o .

17811,"deb mcdonald reveals a little bit of ngpl ' s strategy in interview ngpl recontracts with nipsco natural gas pipeline company of america ( ngpl ) continues to move through the recontracting process like a hot knife through butter . since kinder morgan took over ngpl parent kn energy last year , the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements and contract extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the midwest , including another deal announced yesterday with northern indiana public service ( nipsco ) . ngpl and nipsco signed a contract extending the terms of several firm transportation agreements totaling 295 , 100 mmbtu / d of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and dec . 1 , 2001 and continuing through nov . 30 , 2002 . they also extended the terms of two storage agreements totaling 10 . 5 bcf of capacity beginning dec . 1 , 2000 and april 1 , 2001 and continuing through march 31 , 2003 . nipsco , a nisource subsidiary , is a regulated utility that provides natural gas o nearly 700 , 000 customers and electricity to 416 , 000 customers across the northern third of indiana . "" virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year , "" said ngpl president deborah mcdonald in an interview . "" basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year . we ' ve been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [ nigas , nipsco and peoples ] . "" despite increasing competitive pressure from northern border and alliance pipeline , the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators . "" in contrast to the traditional market of long - haul transportation from the midcontinent and louisiana to chicago , we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core ldcs . obviously the contract that we signed earlier this year with aquila energy for 500 , 000 mmbtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts , "" mcdonald said . "" we also have developed a number of new rate services for gas - fired power generators . growth in ngpl will come from natural gas - fired generation . you probably saw our press release about the ameren contracts for [ construction of 1 , 700 mw of generation along the ngpl system ] . in the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3 , 000 mw of gas - fired generation this year and over 3 , 000 mw next year as well [ which would represent up to 900 mmcf / d in gas transportation capacity ] . "" obviously another challenge is going to be [ the 1 . 325 bcf / d ] alliance pipeline coming into the market this fall . it ' s anyone ' s guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time . i think a lot of that will be coming into chicago and moving back out on vector . but we ' re ready at hub america to kind of serve as a giant header system [ with texas eastern as an eastbound partner ] . "" mcdonald was not prepared , however , to announce the results of a recent open season for about 100 mmcf / d of capacity that will be available through a new interconnection between ngpl and tetco for eastbound transportation .",Safe Email

"" fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says . as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter . fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon . while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins . in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

Date: Not suppliedI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing._It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-FiBroadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

17925,"anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the Greens. A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it. So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization.The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the ""Medieval Warm Period"". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory.Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out. Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.A good link is: http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&CID=2051- 060302A > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Jim > Whitehead > Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 12:23 PM > To: Robert Harley; fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: RE: Goodbye Global Warming > > > Gary Lawrence Murphy wrote: > > >and say hello to the cool: Oooo ... /this/ is going to cause > > some stir ... > > > > Of course not.

9685,"Hiya folks,I'm currently running RawHide, since I had the brilliant idea that, by
using APT, it might actually be practical to keep up with the
developments.However, APT seems to want a recompile - its sometimes leaving the RPM
database in need of a db_recover - and gcc 3.2 seems to require a closer
adherence to the standard than the C++ in APT was written for.This is a bit of a bummer.Does anyone know if there's a latest version I could try which might
work, or whether I should simply do the porting myself? (I've made a
start, but there's a fair amount of work to do.)If this works out, I might start a repository for the freshrpms compiled
on vLatest RawHide, for my own purposes and anyone else who's
interested.Dave._______________________________________________

should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
the owners too... :)Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.- Matthew

> Vendors wrote their own wierd-ass installers & config tools to lock

> availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competitionI think the words you are looking for are ""competitive advantage"" or
""differentiation"".Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software
distribution mechanisms of their own organisations.IMHO, as always...
- Matthew[1] Depending on your world view, this may be rephrased as ""they need to
make oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive."" This discussion
is beyond the scope of this list. :)[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.__________________________________________________

"" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , "" chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview . earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years . future options for the broadband business include "" sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities "" he said .

"" what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , "" chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call . lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm . houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 . the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago .

' ' investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas - pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t confident enron was detailing all its problems . failed businesses the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the past four quarters . included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and international business machines corp . new power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies . the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be more specific . enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers . the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron said . enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than $ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill , lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' ' lay said . excluding losses minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier . shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 . ` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 . ` ridiculous investments ' at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses . enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water , from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million . in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier . revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million . ` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments . ' ' while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money . the company gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including coal , forest products and steel . ` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' ' hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and clear , and that the effort is there .

have renamed it, but they didn't). It's in the same
redhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the
redhat-release package to find out which version is on the server. 
Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2.If you're using GNOME2 from the beta, I'd upgrade as there were some
important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out
for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again
incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).gary_______________________________________________

7683,"the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of. We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts. We can use private investigators. Yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners). But, they're not secret agents. They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of businessHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before. Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark.Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without SA) rather than yours. Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars. But only if we're given a chance to succeed. - dan -- Dan Kohn -----Original Message----- From: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38 To: Matthew Cline Cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes! - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc. - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information! I don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. Also, some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way.Dan ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing real-time communications platform!

that they need to patch the server, and to re-do it if they think it's
already done...sorry for the lame answer, but it's been so long I've forgotten the
details.Have Fun,

' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ;

15995,"I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
we have at my house:We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
managers' managers ad naseum.The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
they seem all too happy to do.At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.Perplexed,
Elias

12632,"think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with Bureaucracy. Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) Canada. It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own ""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars. They finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?-Ian.

however , there will also be a number of special thematic sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the computational linguistics community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops . the conference structure will mean that the thematic sessions will run as parallel sessions , resulting in smaller and more focussed audiences . when you submit a paper to the conference , you will need to consider whether you want to present the paper in the general sessions or in one of the thematic sessions , which are listed below . for the general sessions , papers are invited on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics , including , but not limited to : pragmatics , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpreting and generating spoken and written language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological models of language ; language-oriented information retrieval and information extraction ; corpus-based language modeling ; machine translation and translation aids ; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems ; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with other modalities in multi-media systems ; message and narrative understanding systems . papers submitted to the thematic sessions are more narrowly targeted at specific topics . the complete list of thematic sessions is as follows ; further information about each can be found at the indicated url . d1 : dialogue management in interactive spoken dialogue systems chairs : diane litman and marilyn walker motivation : the advent of real-time interactive spoken dialogue systems poses special challenges for dialogue management . topics : evaluation , dialogue strategies , repair , system integration , learning / optimizing system behavior , corpus analysis , robust processing , and the requirements dialogue places on generation , speech recognition and synthesis . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ diane / acl99 - theme . html d2 : discourse tagging : uses , results and applications chairs : marilyn walker , julia hirschberg and owen rambow motivation : empirical approaches to discourse processing often rely on tagging texts or dialogues with discourse tags from a wide range of tag sets . topics : discourse tagging for training or testing models of discourse structure , reference , translation , speech acts , topic identification , and speech recognition . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ walker / dtag-acl 99 . html d3 : corpus - based approaches to discourse and dialogue chair : nancy ide this theme treats corpus-based work on any aspect of discourse and dialogue analysis , including co-reference , segmentation , discourse structure , parsing , generation , etc . , especially in the light of relevance to practical applications . http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / calls / acl99 - discourse . html d4 : lexicon and discourse : connections through structure and semantics chairs : laurence danlos , alistair knott , and bonnie webber motivation : with the lexicon becoming a central resource for computing properties of the sentence , one may consider similar gains for computing properties of discourse . topics : lexical semantics of discourse connectives and focus particles , discourse and lexical interpretation , lexicalized grammars for discourse . http : / / www . cogsci . ed . ac . uk / ~ alik / acltheme . html i1 : nlp techniques for cross - language information retrieval chair : douglas oard motivation : systems that use queries or examples in one natural language to find text or speech in another are becoming increasingly important . topics : nlp techniques for query translation , cognate matching and interlingual matching techniques , cross-language gisting using summarization or gloss translation . http : / / www . clis . umd . edu / conferences / acl99clir / i2 : exploring the limits of shallow parsing chair : gregory grefenstette shallow parsing techniques provide a partial analysis of the syntactic structures . theme covers research into : quantifying identifiable linguistic phenomena in a corpus ;

"" a spokesman for enron ' s european headquarters in london headquarters declined to comment . reluctance to trade with enron in europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five - year lows . triggering the slide was news last week the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer . houston - based enron trades a large amount of its volume in the u . s . and europe through its internet enrononline system . last friday the company said trade on enrononline was above average levels with more than 8 , 400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $ 4 billion . traders said enron ' s plight could hit liquidity in european gas and power markets , where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years . one industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the uk electricity market had put on hold their trading enron , which is among the biggest five traders in the market . in mainland europe , where enron has been a major driver of liquidity , potential counterparties are treading with care . "" we are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a ' sleeve ' ( a third party trader ) , "" said a senior trader at one of germany ' s big utilities , who declined to be named . french traders said wariness about dealing with enron had dampened liquidity although enron was still in the market on monday morning . "" enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem , "" said one french trader . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . bandwidth beat : enron puts spotlight back on broadband by michael rieke 10 / 29 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) a dow jones newswires column houston - ( dow jones ) - thanks to enron corp . ( ene ) , the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money . but it won ' t be traders who will cash in on this new potential . it will be class - action attorneys . they ' re already lining up to sue enron in at least five shareholder suits . as of oct . 25 , two of lawsuits had been filed against enron in federal court and three more in texas state court . most of them name as defendants ken lay , enron ' s longtime chairman , former chief executive jeff skilling and andrew fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence oct . 25 . still another suit , which isn ' t a class action suit , was filed naming as defendants members of enron ' s board of directors . all the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships enron set up , many of them managed by fastow . most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with enron . the transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband , water and other enron investments . fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions . as enron ' s chief financial officer , he was being paid to manage the corporation ' s finances . as general partner of two ljm partnerships , he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with enron . he shared in profits of those partnerships . when investors began demanding information about the transactions , enron ' s share price began to slide . with the heat on , enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $ 544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals , among other things . that ' s when the class action attorneys went to work . so far , at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs . enron didn ' t respond to calls asking about the lawsuits . among the law firms representing plaintiffs is milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach , which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit . the release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $ 30 billion from class action lawsuits . the lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market . some of the deals with the ljm partnerships run by fastow "" purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market , "" according to abrams and franks v . enron et al . that could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months . market skeptics have said enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth . enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties , a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year , according to enron . now market watchers will want to know if any of enron ' s trades were done with the ljm partnerships managed by fastow . they will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with chewco investments . that houston company , according to a report in the wall street journal , was managed by michael kopper and was set up in 1997 when kopper was a managing director with enron ' s global equity markets group . he left enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by fastow . do the plaintiffs ' attorneys know whether enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships ?

"" i can work to pay for my meals , "" he ' d tell anyone who would listen . my dad was stricken with alzheimer ' s but the character built in him through the toughest of times remained with him forever . we baby - boomers have been blessed in the sense that we will never truly know the gut wrenching sacrifice that spurned our ancestors to live passionately in times of pitifully dire straits at a time when the whole of america was the underdog that would rise up once again to beat the odds - - true champions of spirit . sitting in the darkened theater tears couldn ' t help but fall . in a sense , the movie brought me to the realization that , like jim braddock , the heroes of america back then were the fathers waiting in mile long work lines to put food on the table to feed starving children . this was father ' s day . i thought about my father and his father before him , with loving humbleness and quiet respect for enduring what i will never face . my memory lingered on the man who gave me life , who often times went to bed hungry , with nothing more than the clothes on his back . he grew up to work hard to provide for his family the privileges he had never known . a really touching movie , i left the theater thankful for all the cinderella men of the depression era - - heroes who rose to the challenge to give their families all the best they could . truly america ' s inspiration in extremely difficult times . - - kathy whirity kathy lives in chicago where she shares her life and love with her husband of 28 years , bill , their two daughters jaime and katie , and two rambunctious retrievers holly and hannah . kathy is a newspaper columnist who writes sentimental musings on family life . you can reach her by clicking here : mailto : kathywhirity @ yahoo . com basket case by vickie baker when your day ' s in a hand - basket heading downhill and your heart is beginning to race , your stomach is threatening mutiny your headache is off the charts , your mailbox is bulging with overdue bills and catalogs - - wastebasket style - - your cat ' s tossed her cookies all over your bed your dog tossed his on the floor , the goldfish all died , the toilet won ' t flush and the parakeet flew the coop , the temperature ' s soaring , ash clogs the air and your lungs are bent out of shape , the shower won ' t work , your attitude stinks and you feel like a basket case , silence the critic inside your head . become a kid again ! ! ! blow bubbles and run through the sprinkler . walk backwards around the block . give yourself a standing ovation . clap long and loud and hard . place a colander on your head then stand by the window and wave . have a picnic lunch in your bathtub . eat purple popsicles a - la - nude . drink from the hose and throw water balloons . ring someone ' s doorbell ' n run . leave a joke on somebody ' s voice mail - anonymously , of course . write an uplifting letter just for yourself . send it off quick ! don ' t chicken out ! put a mark on yourself where you ' ve had it up to . pick up your bath towel and throw it in . give yourself a pat on the back you ' re a basket case no more . - - vickie baker vickie baker and her cat live independently with the help of a daily attendant in denver , colorado . do you enjoy heartwarmers ?

7612,"gene flow and indo - europeans h . m . hubey has made readers of this list aware of an interesting article which appeared in the june 24 , 1995 , issue of science news concerning evidence from dna data indicating a gene flow from anatolia into europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey also points out that there is genetic evidence that nomads from the central eurasian yamna culture spread westward into europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while it is indeed reasonable to link the first migration with the spread of agriculture , it does not follow that those who migrated spoke any form of indo - european ( "" pre - "" , "" proto - "" , or dialects thereof ) . nor does it follow that "" [ i ] t is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of indo - european languages . . . "" we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts",Safe Email

Darwin streaming media serverhttp://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/index.php
MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open StreamingMPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the ""glue"" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.
Both sound interesting, and low $$.- Jimhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

4794,"revised hurricane forecast new hurricane forecast out of csu renowned hurricane soothsayer dr . william gray and his team at colorado state university have scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the season to be more active than average . seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three of them are expected to be intense rather than the four expected in the group ' s prior forecast on june 7 . in round numbers , the august forecast is for three named storms , two hurricanes , and one intense or major hurricane . "" information obtained through july 2000 indicates that the atlantic hurricane season in 2000 is likely to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995 , 1996 , 1998 and 1999 . however , total activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be considerably more active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994 . "" we estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes ( average is 5 . 7 ) , 11 named storms ( average is 9 . 3 ) , 55 named storm days ( average is 47 ) , 30 hurricane days ( average is 24 ) , three intense ( category 3 - 4 - 5 ) hurricanes ( average is 2 . 2 ) , six intense hurricane days ( average is 4 . 7 ) and a hurricane destruction potential ( hdp ) of 90 ( average is 71 ) . collectively , net tropical cyclone activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130 % of the long term average . the early august forecast update is in close to gray ' s dec . 8 , 1999 ) and april 7 forecasts , but somewhat lower than his recent june 7 update .

There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
He is no longer promiscuous."")The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
to gloss that meaning over with population averages. > >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.

pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
""promiscuity"".> >unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.

Some central site to make them available to the rest of the world, every time there's a ""apt-get update""?  :)    Also- I noticed this repo has about an 8K bandwidth.  Is there a way I can put this behind the others, so I don't hammer it for things that are at other repos?  I'm respectful about bandwidth, having lived on dialup for so long.  Now I'm on fiber optic and it's a whole other world...

Inside HP 
Bluetooth: speeds up
July 9, 2002
Browse or bustThrough daily use I've found that Mozilla and Opera Web browsers beat Internet Explorer because of two features: tabbed windows and built-in pop-up killers. But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used proprietary code from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as Secure IE to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.Who do you think should be solving problems of Web site incompatibility: Web builders, users, or browser manufacturers? Let me know at edit@download.com.Wayne Cunningham

""Doomed. Completely, absolutely, utterly!""
Just about everyone agreed that Audiogalaxy is as dead as Napster.""Each time a file-sharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear.""
But some people always find a silver lining.""I might use a file-sharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches.""
A P2P network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me.""I was an occasional Audiogalaxy participant (birthday CD burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). Now I'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine.""
I included this comment because I really like the birthday idea.""It seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like Audiogalaxy.""
With its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work.

3749,"Raymond L. Wallace, 83
Bigfoot Story Teller
(1919-2002)Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray WallaceÂ¹s
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called Â³Bigfoot.Â²  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to todayÂ¹s
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
Â³care and respectÂ² and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.Â©Loren Coleman 2002

Somatotropin 
                    (aka Growth Factor, hGH, HGH, Growth Hormone, GH, Human Growth 
                    Hormone) is naturally produced by the anterior pituitary gland 
                    in the brain and declines with age, so it is a natural substance 
                    already in your body right this moment. HGH is known as the 
                    master hormone because it exerts effects over all other hormones 
                    in the body, including Testosterone, Estrogen, Progesterone 
                    and DHEA. Augmenting declining somatotropin levels by giving 
                    your body daily ingestible somatotropin, can create a more 
                    youthful hormone balance that results in dramatic improvements 
                    in your health.
                    Â  Somatotropin supplementation 
                    is a life-enhancement. Lives that were once shattered by fatigue, 
                    illness or the ravages of aging, now fourish with the help 
                    of somatotropin supplementation.
                    Â  Somatotropin from the pituitary 
                    works by stimulating protein production in all tissues of 
                    the body. This results in an increase in organ healing and 
                    regeneration, which is associated with increase resistance 
                    to illness and injury.
No matter your age, we GUARANTEE
                    you will look and feel BETTER than

584,"re : hpl sale - energy operations task list sally , thanks for our meeting last week . please let me know if you don ' t think we ' ve sufficiently defined the deliverable for business ops . based on feedback from louise - you and i still may not be clearly communicating yet as to what is required . specifically , aep and enron need to agree in writing for each business ops "" process "" or function : 1 . who is going to carry out the business ops processes before and after close . 2 . how control over the process will be handed over from enron to aep . 3 . the necessary it actions required to put the required system functionality in place ( and who is responsible for implementing this ) . the table you developed at the end of last week ( based on bob ' s email ) moves closer to this point . as we discussed on the phone , we need to provide a description of the deliverables for each of the "" systems / activities "" you listed on the table and ensure that aep understands ( and signs off on ) what they are responsible for . to anne ' s point , this "" sign off "" can be through a memo , protocol , acknowledged email , or other . we have been having a problem in that one part of aep does not talk to the other part . so , i would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual bob hall / steve jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of aep ( and enron ) understand what is being agreed before we close . each tuesday at 4 : 00 we have a standing hpl transition coordination meeting to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group . you are welcome to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each wednesday with bob h . and tommy y . to concentrate on hpl / it / business ops matters . sally , thanks for you personal attention to this . the quicker we close the quicker bob can focus more of his time on network ' s origination efforts . regards , brian enron north america corp . from : sally beck 03 / 30 / 2001 03 : 34 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect , brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : bob m hall / na / enron @ enron , leslie reeves / hou / ect @ ect , anne c koehler / hou / ect @ ect , anne c koehler / hou / ect @ ect subject : hpl sale - energy operations task list i talked with anne koehler in legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from energy operations prior to the effective sale of hpl . anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "" protocol "" into these discussions . to clarify , according to anne , the "" protocol "" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document . instead , anne envisions simply e : mails or memos between enron and aep with regard to any sharing of information , agreements on processes to be followed in the transition , etc . operational details to be decided between enron and aep have been handled exactly in that manner to date , with e : mails being sent from bob ball ( enron ) to steve jackson ( aep ) . only critical changes to the purchase and sale agreement will be formally documented . bob hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original purchase and sale agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of may . he has worked with enron ' s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with sandi braband in legal to document this change to the purchase and sale agreement as an amendment to that agreement . as of today , legal has completed revisions to that amendment and anne koehler is sending it to mary perkins in enron ' s treasury group for her review . upon mary ' s review , anne will forward the amendment to aep for their review before final signatures . we devised this week a new format for incorporating the aep - hpl transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you . this new format incorporates the various memos and e : mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues . items that only require actions by enron will be our "" to do "" list . each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress . those items that fall under the aep list or which appear in both the enron and aep list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to aep and / or their agreement via the e : mails or memos as suggested by ann koehler . i believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "" protocol "" . we will also update you weekly on the status of those e : mails and / or memos between ourselves and aep . i understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the hpl sale . to provide clarity for these update meetings , may i suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches : 1 ) brian and i hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status , or 2 ) i attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you . please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week .",Safe Email

1498,"Evening Standard - 28 August 2002[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a ""big huddle"".  The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter."" 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.-------------------------------------------------------

11730,"Surely it would be faster to save you conf files, install it on the box
again, copy back you confs and voila.
All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line. Only kidding but thats what I would do.CW----------------
OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave2. rpm -ivh glibc--i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel--i386.rpmThis installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs--i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs--i386.rpmfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.Thanks guys...> [snip]

admin will be done locally.Conor[1] ""it"" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD
K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

14570,"the "" hacek "" "" hacek "" is the diminutive of the czech word "" hak "" , meaning hook . if i ' m not mistaken , a lot of czechs attribute the innovation to the religious and linguistic reformer jan hus ( 1369 ? - 1415 ) . my sources , however , have him introducing a dot over the letters to indicate palatalization rather than a hacek . one of my czech pedagogical grammars claims haceks were appearing in czech manuscripts in the late 13th century , while another explains that the language 's diacritical conventions stabilized around the end of the 16th century , and that publications of the church of the czech brethren used haceks rather than hus 's dots . any of those who introduced the hacek could , in my uneducated opinion , have seen haceks in hebrew manuscripts like those described in alice faber 's recent posting , but we do n't know that . by the way , i ' ve recently seen haceks used in phonological renderings of swiss german in journals from berne dating around 1920 ( "" beitraege zur schweizerdeutschen grammatik "" ) . last year i also saw in the czech press one or two essays by czech jounalists stationed overseas who complained about the peculiarity of haceks ( e . g . , they ' re not found on most international typewriter keyboards ) and how it would make their lives easier if the czechs would adopt some more "" ordinary "" way of rendering the sounds in question . i very much doubt , however , that their opinion is much shared by their colleagues and compatriots . james kirchner",Safe Email

2479,"typological method pace fritz newmeyer , there has been extensive discussion of the methodological issues that he raises . ( these remarks are independent of any assessment of johanna nichol 's book that fritz referred to , incidentally . ) first , good typological work devotes a substantial amount of effort to defining and delimiting what sorts of constructions should or should not belong to a particular structural type . good examples are many of dryer 's papers ( e . g . dryer 1989a , 1989b , 1992 ) , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 : ch . 1 - 3 on nominalizations , stassen 1985 : ch . 2 , 4 on comparative and ' chaining ' constructions , and haspelmath 1993 : ch . 2 on indefinite pronouns . more generally , the discussion of the proper typological markedness criteria in croft 1990 : ch . 4 - 6 is an attempt to provide some * general * structural criteria for a large class of cross-linguistic phenomena ( see for example the formulation of the structural consequences of hopper & thompson 1980 's transitivity hypothesis on p . 131 , or the application of the criteria to the syntactic category problem in croft 1991 : ch . 2 - 3 ) . delimiting and classifying the phenomena to be analyzed is not a simple descriptive task ; in fact , it raises some of the most interesting issues in typological analysis , and have hardly been ignored in the typological literature . second , with respect to basicness for a language type in particular , in the passage from croft 1990 that fritz referred to ( pp . 33-36 ) , i argued that typologists had moved from classifying languages typologically to classifying constructions typologically , and that that was a good thing . nevertheless , i suggested some general criteria for determining a "" basic "" language type . and despite my reservations about identifying "" basic "" language types , it has to be said that in the great majority of cases , defining a "" language type "" instead of a "" construction type "" is not terribly difficult . matthew dryer ( p . c . ) has observed that inspection of texts generally tells you very quickly what the "" word order type "" of a language is . in my own experience , in a study where i am comparing the syntax of prenominal and postnominal modifiers , i am quite frustrated at how difficult it is to find languages where a modifier freely occurs both pre - and postnominally . of course , identification of "" basic "" or other types depends on what resources you have available to you ( quality of grammatical descriptions , availability of texts / language consultants etc . ) as well as what phenomenon you are studying ( e . g . word order or head marking [ easier ] vs . relative order of modifiers or the syntax of nonrestrictive modification [ harder ] ) . but for most studies it is not an insurmountable problem , although there always some problematic cases . third , the sampling problem * has * been discussed at some length by typologists ( besides bell 1978 's seminal article , see also dryer 1989c , perkins 1989 , croft 1990 : 18-25 , rijkhoff et al . 1993 ) . the issues are too complex to go into here at length . but it should be pointed out that the issues fritz raises apply to different sorts of samples with different purposes in mind . the question of how independent particular instances are have to do with probability samples ( see in particular the dryer , perkins and croft references for discussion of these problems ) . note in particular that the stability of the phenomenon being studied is an important factor : the less stable it is , the more likely cases are historically independent . the question of coming across rare types pertains to variety samples ( see in particular rijkhoff et al . ) . some studies ( e . g . tomlin 1986 , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 , haspelmath 1993 ) draw on a very large variety sample and then select a stratified probability sample from it for the appropriate generalizations . dryer 's sampling technique attempts to combine the needs of variety and probability samples into a single sampling procedure . i should also add that with the shift towards dynamic ( diachronic ) interpretations of synchronic typological patterns , the examination of cognate phenomena in related languages , and the comparison of "" nonbasic "" as well as basic typological strategies , becomes another important method of analysis . that means that to some extent , the problems of basic vs . nonbasic types in a single language , and of historical relatedness of data sets , can be avoided - - - in fact , exploited - - - in modern typological analysis . bill croft references : bell , alan . 1978 . language samples . universals of human language , vol . 1 : method and theory , ed . joseph h . greenberg , charles a . ferguson and edith a . moravcsik , 123-156 . stanford : stanford university press . croft , william . 1990 . typology and universals . cambridge : cambridge university press . - . 1991 . syntactic categories and grammatical relations : the cognitive organization of information . chicago : university of chicago press . dryer , matthew . 1989a . plural words . linguistics 27 . 865-95 . - . 1989b . article - noun order . cls 25 . 84-97 . - . 1989c . large linguistic areas and language sampling . studies in language 13 . 257-92 . - . 1992 . the greenbergian word order correlations . language 68 : 81 - 138 . hopper , paul and sandra a . thompson . 1980 . transitivity in grammar and discourse . language 56 . 251-299 . koptjevskaja - tamm , maria . 1988 . a typology of action nominal constructions . stockholm : university of stockholm . perkins , revere d . 1989 . statistical techniques for determining language sample size . studies in languagea013 : 293-315 . rijkhoff , jan , dik bakker , kees hengveld & peter kahrel . a method of language sampling . studies in language 17 . 169-203 . stassen , leon . 1985 . comparison and universal grammar . oxford : basil blackwell . tomlin , russell . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . dept of linguistics , u manchester , oxford rd , manchester m13 9pl , uk w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk fax : + 44-61 - 275 3187 phone : 275 3188",Safe Email

16854,"workshop on semi - lexical heads * * call for papers * * workshop on semi-lexical heads tilburg university , thursday 20 may and friday 21 may 1999 invited speakers : joseph emonds ( university of durham ) hubert haider ( university of salzburg ) elisabeth loebel ( university of cologne ) semi-lexical heads the distinction between lexical / major categories , on the one hand , and functional / minor / grammatical categories , on the other , is at the heart of present-day grammatical theory , but plays an equally central role in theories on language acquisition , code switching , aphasia , etcetera . in the course of time , various diagnostic criteria have been proposed which distinguish the one class from the other : e . g . productivity , distribution , lack versus presence of semantic content . although for certain clear-cut cases ( e . g . the distinction between noun and determiner ) , this distinction is quite straightforward , there are many lexical items for which it is less easy to decide whether they side with the lexical categories or with the functional ones . the category p is a well-known case of uncertainty . although it seems less functional in a sense than a determiner , it is more "" grammatical "" than n , v and a . some people have argued that a distinction should be made within the class of prepositions between the lexical ones and the grammatical or functional ones ( cf . van riemsdijk 1990 ; zwarts 1992 ) this gradualness on the lexical-functional "" scale "" is characteristic of other categories as well and is reminiscent of ross 's ( 1972 ; 1973 ) notion of squish , which refers to degrees of nouniness ( or verbiness ) of syntactic categories . emonds ( 1985 ) speaks bout grammatical nouns , verbs , adjectives and prepositions , and also refers to them as disguised lexical categories . another appropriate term would be semi-lexical heads , i . e . heads which are hybrid in the sense that they display both lexical and functional / grammatical characteristics . what kinds of lexical items might possibly be considered semi-lexical ? for the nominal domain , emonds ( 1985 ) refers to such items as the pro-form "" one "" in "" the good ones "" , reflexive "" self "" ( cf . "" selves "" ) , and "" thing "" as it occurs in "" something good "" . classifiers and quantity-designating nominals in pseudopartitive constructions like "" three grains of sand "" might be considered semi-lexical as well . within the verbal domain , semi-lexical candidates might arguably be : auxiliary verbs ( see emonds 85 for this claim ) , certain verbs featuring in verb clusters in germanic verb raising constructions , verbs in serialization constructions , etcetera . within the adjectival domain , one might take such quantifiers as "" many "" , "" few "" , "" much "" as instances of semi-lexical adjectives . the above is just a brief sketch of potential semi-lexical heads . presumably , there are many more . here are some of the more concrete questions that might arise in the study of semi-lexical heads : v what types of semi-lexical nouns , verbs , adjectives and prepositions can be distinguished ? what distinguishes them from truly lexical categories and in what sense are they different from truly grammatical functors ? is this distinction expressed in terms of their lexical feature-composition , and if so , what features are involved ? what is their assembling property ; i . e . how do they combine in syntactic structure and how do they project syntactically ? are they involved in idiosyncratic displacement phenomenona , and if so , what feature of the semi-lexical head triggers this ? what is the licensing function of semi-lexical heads ? what makes them interpretable at the interface levels ? also from a diachronic point of view , the question arises how lexical heads develop gradually into semi-lexical ones . is there cross-linguistic variation in the range of semi-lexical heads and if so , what does this variation reside in ? besides the question of how semi-lexical heads behave in the syntactic component , questions arise about their behavior in other components : are there morphological processes characteristic of semi-lexical heads ? as concerns the lexicon , the question arises how they are stored in the lexicon and what distinguishes their lexical entry from that of truly lexical categories . abstracts : abstracts are invited for 30 minutes talks ( with an additional ten minutes for discussion ) . abstracts should be anonymous , and should be no longer than two pages , including references and examples , with margins of at least 1 - inch , font size 11 / 12 . submissions are limited to a maximum of one individual and one joint abstract per author . please provide 5 anonymous abstracts and one camera-ready original containing title , author 's name and affiliation . submissions by e-mail or fax can be accepted , provided a camera-ready original is received within one week after the deadline . a separate card should contain the title of the paper , author 's name , affiliation , address , telephone number and e-mail address . we have the intention to publish ( a selection of ) the papers . we expect to be able to partially reimburse you for travel and / or vhotel expenses , but precise figures are not available as yet . * * * * * * * * * * * deadline for receipt of abstracts : monday 1 february , 1999 . abstracts should be sent to the following address : norbert corver grammar models group department of linguistics tilburg university p . o . box 90153 5000 le tilburg the netherlands phone : + 31 13 4662773 e - mail : secretariaat . gm . fdl @ kub . nl fax : + 31-13 - 4663110 organizing committee : norbert corver & henk van riemsdijk information about accommodation and travel information will be made available at the grammar models web site , which is accessible at : http : / / cwis . kub . nl / ~ fdl / research / gm / conf . htm",Safe Email

3553,"PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEGOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""###   ###   ###Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
interviews on this topic.Contact: Larry Benson

16795,"Hi,I've got an normal 3.5"" CD-RW IDE drive that I'd like to be able to use with a
Dell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this,
for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROM
or floppy drive is normally).There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's docking
solution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDE
drive, only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a ""non-Dell"" solution that's
compatible.Anyone any ideas?Thanks,Darren.

20020711 Lockergnome Tech Specialist
Â  07.11.2002 GnomeREPORT 
CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS: If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of Computer Basics in the GnomeStore. Chris teams with TechTV cohort, Kate Botello, to lead novices on a journey through their computer. From basic interactions, to installing apps, to using the Internet and e-mail, Chris and Kate have all the basics covered. Help out a friend and  get them a copy today.    Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
between the five different computers and have Internet 
access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
here]. Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
that he'll have a front yard left by then.The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
drive home later since they were only getting started at 
that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Satellite Internet Delays Add Up
http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm
Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet 
provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative.

PGP Outlook Plug-in Vulnerability
http://www.nai.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/patches/patch-pgphotfix.asp
Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available 
on their website.

Intro to Relational Databases
http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm
You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
There's a lot more to database management and development 
than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
usually results in additional work later.

Smile While You Surf
I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default? Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:Roses are red
Our web site is resting
We're fixing the server
While EverquestingIn the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU."" You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
Connect the dots!

the music playing.By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
CD.Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.- Jim

much less elsewhere.  Population estimates vary wildly and about all
your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark
figures.  While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast
areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very
sparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have
been 2 million or so.There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from
20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century,
certainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other
factors, and was probably in decline before contact.  Others claim it
declined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95%
mortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which
makes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt.About all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600,

Microsoft will continue to build in its ""Active Directory"" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft executives said this week. The directory technology essentially provides a network manager with a central database to store and manage information about users, computer systems and networking devices. Microsoft competes against Novell and Sun Microsystems in the directory-server software market.

Pittman set to leave AOL Time WarnerAOL Time Warner is expected to announce after the stock markets close Thursday that embattled chief operating officer Robert Pittman will relinquish his role as the media behemoth's No. 2 executive, according to a source close to the company.
Pittman, who also serves as the interim chief exective of the company's America Online unit, could remain at the online division until a permanent CEO is found. But the timetable for Pittman's departure will be based on his own decision, the source added. AOL Time Warner last week confirmed that it hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to head AOL's CEO search.

1195,"I love the absurd sense of humor it takes to build up such an elaborate 
evening only to note that ""even if the date's a bust you can always have 
a hundred people up for cocktails"" in your penthouse suite at the end of 
the night :-)Personally, I'd put one point in favor of the Redwood Room over Lapis: 
on a weeknight, you can still whip out a TiBook and write, since it's a 
hotel bar. And it seems to give people all sorts of license to 
interrogate you as to why you're writing with a double of scotch :-)Best,

Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message

not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail

had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I

a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.--j.

In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread

am glad I trusted him because I would normally ignore a pitch 
like that

its sounded to good to be true. I appeased him and replied with 
the answers

13606,"Hi there,Now this is probably of no use to you whatsoever, but...Not a deb-head, but I also have a problem regards NVidia. I've two machines,
pretty much the same hardware. 
athlon 1700XP's, both have NVidia cards, one Gforce3 Ti and a Gforce2MX,
both use the same driver module. Both have same kernel version albeit it compiled for their particular
hardware.One works perfectly, the other fails to load. When I check with lsmod, I can
see the NVdriver is loaded, but not used ;--(
Thus when I startx, it bombs out. IU still have X with the default nv driver and crappy accelleration -->
650fps with glxgears [should be over 2000fps]
Its not a hardware issue with the cards as I swapped them over and get the
same symptoms. I reckon my mobo is cack, I've tried swapping slots around, reserving
resources etc all to no avail. 
Should there be an interrupt for the nv card? I haven't checked the other
box yet.Regards,

likely nothing to do with the driver itself.  You should be able to use kdm

When it *is* working do a quick /sbin/lsmodand look for the module name (something like 'NVDriver').  Then put this on
a new line in /etc/modulesin order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just domodprobe nvdriverto load it by hand.  Your make install did this as well as reinstalling the
driver in /lib etc.  You should also get a message saying loading the
nvidia driver taints your kernel (which it does, in the sense that it's not
open source).> Is this a problem anyone else has encountered and what is the best

However, nvidia have not open sourced it (most of the above source is
pre-compiled object code), but in order for it to work with your specific
kernel you must compile against your kernel headers (as you did).  As
debian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package
and have chosen instead to provide the source.  Actually I don't know if
they're permitted to distribute binaries by nvidia's license anyway.Gavin--

10306,"REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP Dear Sir,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ï¿½TOP SECRET.ï¿½ 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the
Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man
tender board appointed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: (a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. (b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. (c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and I will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when I have heard from you. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. Thank you and God bless. Yours faithfully, Dr. Osaro Ame __________________________________________________

> ....and with the crucial hair feature enabled!That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 
improves my day immeasurably.I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 
thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
ick!"" when you might have a great time together.We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
actually sound.Eirikur

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",Phishing Email

money from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions
available for almost-unrestricted distribution (not ""for value"") via CD
duplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for
boxed-set sales.For example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the ""FTP edition"" 
in ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they
see the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the
moment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to
buy boxed sets, instead.  Likewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the
""evaluation"" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it
several versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a
boxed set, after ""evaluating"" SuSE via the ISO image.Again, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All
we know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a
bit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.Those permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,
YaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other
utilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every
right to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.> One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't understand was that SuSE
> had proprietary extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to
> use under the GPL or even under  a FreeBSD style licence.Hmm, let's slow down, here:  There's a persistent misconception that
it's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without
his permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would
make that possible.The copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,
and is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse
licences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence
statement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of
copyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say
that it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to
have open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence
from the copyright holder.)No Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software
without their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur
at all. 
 
You cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing
it under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at
all other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you
simply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright
violation.> I thought that the model for the likes of SuSE was selling support and

contributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same
CDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores
(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I'm 100% certain they
could and would have done so.Guess what?  They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give
you copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was
require that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to 
be able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.Spirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew
exactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed
software is exactly what they had in mind.

> 
> Ai-je tort?Mais si.You are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of
the GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy
of any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to
matching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered
binary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the
distributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide 
exactly that access.Or so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed
codebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source
code they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us
which codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not
any of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)> My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for

> don't know what the going rate is.Your understanding is almost correct, but not quite.  (1) The access
provisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.
(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered
binaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually
placed under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of 
placing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL
it.In fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from
enemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers
that using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings
will ""taint"" their copyrights and force them to put their property under
the GPL.  It's simply not so.> If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a different issue, and
> one for which I would be willing to pay.That's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed
sets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or ""borrow"".
For one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of
components, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_
proprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)
to hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in
the first place.
 
> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!If you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent
distribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include
some other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to
find them being copied or ""borrowed"". > I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can
> borrow them, but not copy them? No.Look, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be
lawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,
then _not_ erasing it but merely letting you ""borrow"" the CDs results in
the product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised
copying.> And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say,
> trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE
> appears, at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up
> proprietary and open stuff.Well, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera
eDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,
either.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,
Linux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail
sets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.
 
(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing
question.)-- 
Cheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.

- but how can we perceive those regularities ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there are no observable constraints on infererring ? - but if there are , where do they come from and how are they actually implemented mentally ? - and finally : how do we come to act rationally , that is , in accordance with what we have perceived , processed and inferred . we are interested in all ways of defining rules and in all aspects of rule following , from the definition of law , rule , regularity , similarity and analogy to logical consequence , argumentational and other inferences , statistical and linguistic rules , practical and strategic reasoning , pragmatic and praxeological activities . we expect contribution from the following research fields : game-theory , action theory , argumentation theory , cognitive science , linguistics , philosophy of language , epistemology , pragmatics , psychology and semiotics . we would be happy to include some contributions from natural sciences such as neuro-biology , physiology or brain sciences . the conference is organized in three major sections : philosophy , psychology and linguistics with six keynote lectures . then contributions of 30 minutes ( 20 for paper and 10 for discussion ) will follow . we also plan to organize a workshop at the end of each section abstracts : abstracts should be one-page ( maximum 23 lines ) specifying area of contribution and the particular aspect of rule-following to be addressed . abstracts should be sent by e-mail to : tarnay @ btk . jpte . hu or bocz @ btk . jpte . hu . hard copies of abstracts may be sent to : laszlo tarnay department of philosophy janus pannonius university , ifjusag utja 6 , h-7624 pecs , hungary important dates : deadline for submission : march 15 , 1998 notification of acceptance : march 25 , 1998 conference : april 30 - may 1 - 2 , 1998 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * for those concerned there is a follow-up philosophical colloquium : john mcdowell : mind and world - kant in analytic philosophy which discusses mcdowell 's recent book : mind and world . among would-be participants are barry allen , michael williams and robert brandon . if interested , contact prof . janos boros , dept . of philosophy , janus pannonius university . e-mail : boros @ btk . jpte . hu",Safe Email

12715,"sum : analogy to 1sg some time ago i posted query asking for an an example of an analogical development in the inflectional system of any language , preferably an indo - european language , whereby the 2d and 3d persons singular were remade in the image of the 1st sg . the very possibility of such a development appears to have been denied in an important article by cowgill on the reflexes of ie laryngeals in greek , and it struck me as a bizarre claim , but i could not found any ready counterexamples . i would like to thank robert hoberman , lars borin , dana paramskas , george fowler , maggie winters , and max wheeler for responding . the closest to what i am looking for was identified by wayles browne : polish present tenses of the verb ' to eat ' : jem 1sg jesz 2sg je 3sg of these , only jem is inherited . the other two forms have been remade analogically , replacing what would be expected to come out as * jesi , * jes ' c ' . however , even this example is not completely compelling since it seems that the analogy here involves this verb taking the endings typical of another conjugation rather than specifically remodeling the 2sg and 3sg on the basis of the 1sg . so , was cowgill right ? can 1sg never serve as the basis for an analogical remaking of 2sg and 3sg ? ( there are examples of 2sg being ( re ) modeled on 1sg , robert hoberman pointing out that this is what happened in the perfect of ge ' ez , and i have since also found discussion of this happening in some yemeni arabic dialects , but the 3sg is not affected in any of these cases ) . alexis manaster ramer",Safe Email

case statement, which IMHO is cleaner than using an if statement if you
have a lot of branches... but then again maybe that should be refactored
away with polymorphism :)

That's my understanding of how it works anyway. > > John > > Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.Therefore: export CFLAGS=""-O3 -march="" && CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGSThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not prepared to go to this length.For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.Cheers, John Gay-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
bootp and tftp server somewhere....hth,

Dec. 1, 2002KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.Hamano admits to the allegations.Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.

the actual rawhide ""libstdc++.so.5.0.0"" file to another directory, removed that

(new apt does not like it), make that symlink ""libstdc++.so.5"" point to that
rawhide file I moved earlier.Apt works again, dump the Limbo II rpms into a dir, run the ""genaptrep.sh rh73"",
but ""topdir"" arg had changed, edit script, rerun, makes apt repository for Limbo
II. Do ""apt-get --ignore missing -f dist-upgrade"". Apt wants to uninstall itself
because that rawhide libstdc++ package is not installed, but apt works for the
moment because of that symlink I made.Apt stays installed just long enough to issue the necessary ""dist-upgrade""
commands, several hours later, I have Limbo II, shiny and new. The install even
made that symlink point back to the correct libstdc++ file.Several hours after that, I read my mail and realize that ""null"" directory I kept

16302,"I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
the kernel code.Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
of the MMX processor.Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
And would this require re-building gcc as well?I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
had much luck.Cheers,	John Gay--

16783,"re : biz , the momentum investor report domingo hurst , sequoia interests trading symbol sqnc pk what if a company had a product that would allow oil wells to produce much more oil ? what would that stock be worth with todays oil prices close to 50 usd per barrel ? 10 , 20 , 30 , 100 usd ? and now several of the major oil companies are currently testing the product . at 0 . 50 we think sqnc is a homerun . to solve this problem , the oil industry is looking for new alternatives for increased exploration and production . the clear solution for increased demand and consumption can already be found in the ground , with nearly two thirds of oil left in the ground at us wells , too technically complex or expensive to extract with traditional technologies . enhanced oil recovery , eor , is an exciting new frontier in the oil and gas industry which you are going to hear more of in the coming years . sqncs innovative new product , diamondflo , could be at the forefront of this frontier . sqnc has strong interest from major oil and gas companies for testing and potential licensing of this product , and is in the final stages of the research and development of diamondflo . with testing expected to be completed in the next 60 to 90 days , and planned patent application shortly thereafter , announcements from sqnc could cause price gains for this stock over the coming months . what is more , diamondflos unique chemical properties , make it an ideal solution for a number of other application in the oil and gas industry , including remediation and environmental cleanup of oil fields , refineries , and storage facilities ; an estimated 8 . 1 billion market . with this revolutionary product in the development pipeline , sqnc has also made some aggressive moves into oil and gas production with its recent acquisition of leases in pecos valley , texas . these operations will act as a testbed for development and validation of the diamondflo product and could provide an additional revenue stream and source of cash flow for sqnc . with the commercialization of its diamondflo product looming near , we feel that it is only a matter of time before wall street recognizes this stock . what is more , sqnc is positioned within an industry that has seen tremendous upside growth , and is headed for even more appreciation as the global oil crisis demands new production solutions . over the last twelve months , the oil well services and equipment industry has seen an average price gain of more than 88 percent , and savvy investors in emerging companies have witnessed tremendous profits . we believe that sqnc is one of the most revolutionary new companies on the market . with major announcements stemming from the completion of r and d on diamondflo , do you think sqnc could make a nice move in the coming day ? . a few reasons to own sqnc . 1 . with its innovative diamondflo product , sqnc is positioned to help alleviate the impending oil and gas crisis , with producers struggling to keep up with growing us energy demands , as foreign exploration and production comes under increasing geopolitical pressures . increased consumption demands have combined with an increasingly unstable international production climate to create some of the highest prices seen at the pump since the 1970 s oil embargo , and crude oil prices on the spot market have recently approached the 50 usd mark . as oil companies seek new ways to maximize domestic oil recovery , the chemical eor approach of sqnc will be a major factor in increasing production and removing dependence on foreign oil . 2 . enhanced oil recovery , eor , represents the logical next step in expanding domestic oil production , and represents a tremendous and presently underappreciated market potential . over two thirds of oil in us reservoirs is left unproduced after primary and secondary production , leaving an incredible and untapped source for us energy needs . according to the us department of energy , eor has the potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil , 50 percent more than the current us proven reserves of 23 billion barrels , and even greater than the us estimated undiscovered potential of 30 billion barrels . with its diamondflo chemical eor solution , sqnc could be ideally positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on production from these untapped oil reserves . 3 . sqnc has developed a revolutionary chemical eor product , diamondflo which offers tremendous advantages over thermal and gas eor methods . thermal and gas , primarily co 2 injection to stimulate production are costly and require a complex infrastructure , while other chemical eor products have had limited success and are environmentally damaging . by contrast , diamondflo is expected to generate recovery of 20 to 40 percent above current methods , is environmentally safe and meets strict regulatory standards for oil recovery and remediation , and will be available to producers at a comparable price point to competitive products . with introduction of diamondflo to the market following completion of testing and development , sqnc could revolutionize the oil and gas industry with this innovative approach to enhanced oil recovery . 4 . in addition to its principal application in eor , sqncs diamondflo product has additional applications in the 8 . 1 billion oil and gas remediation market . during the testing process , diamondflo has demonstrated exceptional remediation properties , with static remediation tests determining that it removed more than 80 percent of hydrocarbons from soil with no significant hydrocarbon emulsion , mixing of oil and water . this discovery paves the way for eventual application in environmental cleanup of oil facilities or spills , and opens up a tremendous new market for sqnc . since 1992 , the american petroleum industry estimates that over 90 billion has been spent by the oil and gas industry to protect the environment , with 8 . 1 billion spent annually in environmental expenditures . this publication is an independent publication with the goal of giving investors the necessary knowledge to make

17209,"I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine. Greg[1] http://freeware.sgi.com/

2055,"that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100"" which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   This year's SIC gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of 
TopStyle 3.0. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the 
Training From the Source 
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of 
Dreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeMAIL

of a text editor. This tool provides a visual representation of all 
configurable options available to Apache admins, offering great 
learning capabilities for newer webmasters, as well as saving time for 
experienced administrators who tire of scrolling through screen after 
screen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the 
file easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, 
similar to the way HTML editors mark code. Avoid typos with built-in 
error checking, which provides warnings when invalid directives are 
used.

Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards
http://www.maccaws.com/Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number 
crunchers in a business don't feel are as important, when compared against 
getting the product to as many people as possible in the shortest amount of 
time possible in an effort to generate revenue. Communicating the 
importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a 
voice you'd like to add to their cause, visit them on the Web and help

"" as seen on national television "" "" making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only $ 25 us dollars expense one time . thanks to the computer age and the internet , be a millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say , "" no way ! "" read the following . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless , and fun way to make some extra money at home . and , besides even if you never got involved in the program , the reports themselves are well worth the money . they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet . that is , these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet . the results of this show have been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it . "" here it is below "" * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment ( $ 25 ) and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave your house except to get the mail . simply follow the instructions , and you really can make this happen . this e - mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non - commercialized method of advertising now ! the longer you wait , the more savvy people will be taking your business using e - mail . get what is rightfully yours . program yourself for success and dare to think big . it sounds corny , but it ' s true . you ' ll never make it big if you don ' t have this belief system in place . multi - level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi - level methods . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience , started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead - panned his response . "" that ' s why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! "" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . here is the basic version of what you need to do : your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do . your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2 within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off , keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build . keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it wasn ' t working . finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! "" think about it . "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" no way ! "" please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps "" a "" through ' g "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 !

to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate !

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 . among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned . demands , demands rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely . if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade . friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition . this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . "" mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity . under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb by christopher edmonds special to thestreet . com 10 / 26 / 2001 05 : 08 pm edt url : while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness . what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . "" peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding . the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes . now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation . the company ' s challenge but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks . "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . "" dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . "" it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline . there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . "" investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer . first things first many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade . the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family . enjoy your weekend with family and friends . dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default 2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york ) by kristen mcnamara of dow jones newswires new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday . the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at risk for expulsion from new england ' s market . but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the past , the market ' s rulemaker said . "" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . "" news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said . "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact happened from time to time .

gas pipelines . that allowed enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books . the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has said . few answers investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a conference call tuesday . today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to questions about one of them , es power 3 llc . texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire enron board is also listed . shares of enron $ 1 . 15 to $ 15 . 20 in late trading . -

- enron corp . , facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a target of investigations and lawsuits in california . california lawmakers and regulators have accused power providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers have denied the charges repeatedly . next month , a california senate committee investigating the power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento , california . ` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said . the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers . ` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to a speedy resolution . ' ' shares of houston - based enron have fallen by more than half since oct . 16 . the company ousted andrew fastow as the chief financial officer wednesday amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron $ 35 million . grand jury enron also is one of the companies being investigated for civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill lockyer , who convened a grand jury in june . lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron chairman kenneth lay in ` ` an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says ` hi my name is spike , honey . ' ' ' lockyer later apologized for the remark . the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power providers might be filed . ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that slowed things down a bit . ' ' enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney general ' s investigation . ` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said . more lawsuits enron , along with other major power providers such as duke energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated california energy prices in violation of antitrust laws . the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a judge by the end of next month , he said . if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including triple damages . enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 , declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80 percent in the past 12 months . - - daniel taub in los angeles , ( 323 ) 801 - 1261 or enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 18 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) ( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low - interest , short - term loans . the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today . chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets , where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer . ` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management . ' ' the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said . bonds drop enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' ' yield 9 . 53 percent . investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital . ' ' though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for seven years . a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value of enron investors ' stock . partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets . other liabilities if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt . one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would thin out the holdings of every other investor . of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' ' one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' ' enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a statement . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom at 609 - 750 - 4651 , or at keller rohrback l . l . p . investigates potential claims on behalf of enron corp . - - ene - - employees and former employees 10 / 26 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans . the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events . on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets . if you are a member of an enron retirement plan , wish to discuss this announcement , or have information relevant to the investigation , you may contact paralegal liza catabay , or any member of our team ( britt tinglum , liza catabay , or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 / 776 - 6044 , or via e - mail at investor @ kellerrohrback . com . seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade . its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars . contact : keller rohrback l . l . p . liza catabay , 800 / 776 - 6044 investor @ kellerrohrback . com www . seattleclassaction . com 15 : 16 edt october 26 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",Safe Email

likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

"" the marketplace needs these things , but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them , "" parker said . "" i applaud what they are doing , but it is an uphill battle . "" enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal , a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers , shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight ' s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer , enron took another step , by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper , but declined to identify it . dan reck , vice president of enron freight markets , said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . "" what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market , "" reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times , and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges , spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid , but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . "" what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable , "" reck said . "" so from a carrier ' s perspective , they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . "" enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets , and is trying to change the way other markets , such as steel , are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . "" we are kind of commodity - agnostic , "" reck explained . "" we don ' t care what the commodity is , we just sell capacity . "" enron ' s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte , the former national transportation exchange , puts buyers and sellers directly together , while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services , enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron ' s ideal contract , damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example , suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile , enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn ' t , enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers , carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ' ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking association or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a forum for negotiations , which the company believes would add legitimacy . in its first contract , enron is acting as a carrier , since the shipper already was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron considers itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves and leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow parties to minimize risk , for example by giving shippers the ability to hedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees . enron is an extensive user of the internet , however , and last year launched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas , oil , electricity and various other commodities online . no one expects enron ' s new freight capacity product to capture immediate acceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck said it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the freight industry , and that enron is prepared for that . "" we have done that in every market we have gotten into , "" reck said . "" what we find is the economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance over time . you have to show what the benefits are . "" jocoo 000 .

15524,"typology of historical change typology of historical change this note tries to make explicit what i take for granted , and have discussed with others on occasion , but which perhaps needs a more explicit statement . one of the most fruitful avenues of research in distant language comparison , i believe , is the growth of the field i call typology of historical change . under this rubric i include for example the work of johanna nichols ( whether or not i agree with any data , findings or particulars of method , is not relevant to my point ; i still think it helps our thinking along ) . i also include , and this is a challenge i want to issue , the * * * mode of discourse * * * in which mr . vovin asked recently for help in finding typological parallels to a hypothesis he was interested in that a phrase meaning "" water falls "" could fossilize ( ? ) into a basic word for "" rain "" . in response to his query , he got back some positive answers , examples which people claimed fit this description . as a method of reasoning , this is what we need more of . that is , more accumulations of attested examples of particular changes , to educate our intuitions of what we naively think are "" possible "" semantic shifts by ever more experience with what actual semantic shifts are known or suspected . it will help us to improve our methods of guestimating possible language relationships , because it will at least say that a given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , so it is not straining to compare lexical items whose meanings differ in such and such a way . whereas by contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is not firmly attested . so such an unattested semantic shift should probably not be used in those distant language comparisons which are themselves the most difficult to do , because over large time spans the number of context-sensitive conditioning environments is as great as the number of lexical items available to compare , and thus there are few or no * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . in other words , as we move towards deeper comparisons , we must more and more rely on ways of measuring "" distance "" of semantic shift and "" distance "" of phonological change , rather than measuring repeating sound correspondences and semantic identities . we do not yet have our tools for doing this very well sharpened , but we can proceed gradually to sharpen them . a study of the known attested cases is the best start . in other words , if someone really wants to see how our methods fare with gradually more distant language comparisons , and to see how some new methods may fare , they should tabulate , for all known language relationships , ( a ) the proportion of sound-correspondence repetition in the comparable vocabulary ( and what "" comparable "" means is itself a variable , not exclusively defined by ( b ) and ( c ) ) ( b ) the "" semantic distance "" along attested paths of semantic change of lexical items being compared . where multiple such shifts have been attested , the estimated "" distance "" counts as closer , smaller . where few such shifts have been attested , the estimated "" distance "" counts as greater . we of course do not have enough such information in database form to use at present , but whatever we do have can be used provisionally , as explained in ( d ) ( c ) the "" phonetic distance "" along attested paths of phonetic change of lexical items being compared . there is relatively more of this knowledge available than for phonological change . ( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of "" closeness "" of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . "" the comparative method "" currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term "" the comparative method "" , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word "" the "" were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term "" comparative methods "" . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson",Safe Email
3159,"I have a strange problem with one user in a small network using ssh.
Everyone in the network uses ssh and they run an ssh-agent on login. This
works fine for conveniently wandering around the network and to some of our
external boxes - or did, until today. Suddenly, when one user (alfred) tries
to ssh anywhere he's asked for a password. He says He changed nothing (don't
they all) but I do actually believe him. I used ssh-keygen to make new keys
but that didn't help. I created a new user alfio into whose home directory I copied alfred's .ssh
directory - alfio can wander around free as a bird without being asked for a
password ever (except of course for the passphrase to load the identiy into
the agent).In case there was something else in Alfred' environment, I copied .??* from
alfred's home directory to alfio's, remembering to change ownership
afterwards. Still alfio is as free as a bird.We use only SSH2 with DSA keys. An extract from a ssh -v for alfio is belowdebug1: got SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
debug1: authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: next auth method to try is publickey
debug1: userauth_pubkey_agent: testing agent key /home/alfio/.ssh/id_dsa

This problem is definitely related to alfred as a user - it happens when he
logs in on differing workstations (all NFS mounting the same home
directories) and the other users (including good old alfio) don't have any
problems.

904,"My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 
1997. Set in the old west.A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.The cowboy thinks a bit, and says ""I want to talk to my horse."" So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says ""I want to 
talk to my horse"". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says ""I want to talk to my horse."" The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- ""Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!""

you might be interested in this. A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very seriously.Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my 
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 1000 
PAID members in my group! As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I 
have more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking 
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free 
sign-ups...like me :)Well, it was true...I had over 1000 paid members in my group. This 
is a program that I had never worked! All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end 
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000
 people. You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this program,
 I would have become an active paid member months ago! With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.

11606,"Once upon a time, Ralf wrote :> Are there any reasons _not_ to use the new apt releases on RH 7.x?Hmmm... I don't see any :-)My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
me) ;-)
Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
secondary rebuild system.Matthias--
