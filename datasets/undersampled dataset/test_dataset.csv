"" simply stated , we have two problems : supply is too low and costs are too high . both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996 . but no matter how we got into this mess , you hired me to solve problems . and that ' s what i ' m doing . "" the only long - term solution is to build more power plants . we must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities . but prices won ' t fall and supply won ' t be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume . "" yet in the 12 years before i took office , not a single major power plant was built in california . not one . since i became governor , we ' ve licensed 12 major power plants . ten more are in the pipeline . and we ' re doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water . "" deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies . the generators are free to charge whatever they want because they ' re governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices . "" this past winter , the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof , driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy . "" in january , with the feds still refusing to do their job , california stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy . we didn ' t take over to save the utilities . we took over to keep the power on and the economy strong . that ' s not all : - - we also negotiated long - term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices . - - i used my emergency powers to seize control of low - cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators . - - we began negotiations to buy the utilities ' transmission system . - - we cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants . - - we ' re launching an $ 800 million conservation program . - - we ' re moving to establish a public power authority to build more power . if the private sector fails to build all the plants california needs , we ' ll build them ourselves . - - and because i share your concern that the generators are ripping us off , we ' re using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct . "" we can ' t fix 12 years of inaction overnight . but we ' re making real progress . "" now , as you know , i have fought tooth and nail against raising rates . it ' s become increasingly clear , however , that with rising natural gas prices , the feds ' failure to control costs , and the state ' s lack of supply , that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong . "" but i remain committed to protecting average californians from massive rate hikes . so i ' m urging the public utilities commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers , reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back . "" under my proposal , more than half of you won ' t pay a penny more . for the rest , the average increase will be 26 1 / 2 percent . for many of that group , rates will rise only about 10 percent . the heaviest users will see their rates rise 34 1 / 2 percent on average . that includes business paying their share . this is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we ' ve all been paying since last winter . "" but all californians can reduce their bills through conservation . "" here ' s the point : the more you use , the more you pay . the more you conserve , the more you save . conservation is our best short - term weapon against blackouts and price - gouging . by flexing your power , you ' ll help secure our energy future . "" unlike the puc , my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability - - if they agree to three main conditions : "" they must provide low - cost regulated power to the state for 10 years . agree to sell us their transmission system . and dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates . "" my proposal raises rates fairly , assures us of long - term power , stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation . "" our emphasis on conservation is critical . in order to make it through the summer , we must cut demand by at least 10 percent . "" already we ' ve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting , and reduce consumption in office buildings , schools and government facilities . "" friends , we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless . we are 34 million strong and if each of us does our part , we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer . we are californians . we ' ve withstood earthquakes , floods , fires , and droughts .

  beberg@mithral.comPitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ETBERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
bar is pitch black.The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
actually been eating.",Safe Email

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture captionReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have

9125,"I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?Any ideas would be welcome.Thanks,
Joe

It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as

    E> that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with
    E> little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.Could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the
humanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms
per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength
enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel?  This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need
to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or
carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under
weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength
cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
muscular enhancement.    E> As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK
    E> not really well explained in the comic series. If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure
modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to
think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then
what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout
the entire nervous system.  Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly
hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal
sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,
everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle
hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;
don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We
know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time
was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself
already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination.Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine
if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological
'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but
just the ""driver of the bus"".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his
self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
cognitive time-scales.--

Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.Please do not use the reply button, reply only to Edmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.Mr. EDWARD MULETE

independent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain'
in that pickle is under 0.21.  'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets
0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more
than cancel it out.WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),
   so that the tags aren't getting stripped.  The pickled classifier
   despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the
   latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for
   example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just
   says something like ""This is an HMTL message."").If it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize()
meaning ""even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway"".  In fact, I'd like
to do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists
strikes me as, umm, extreme .> So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).That would be a different experiment.  I'm certainly curious to see whether

10849,"dated material please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully , immediately print and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! i did n't believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters out . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just could n't believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this exactly works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying "" please put me on your mailing list "" and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other 's lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed !

' s credit and debt ratings have fallen to junk status , crippling what once was the largest u . s . energy trader , observers are pointing fingers , and wondering what took the top three u . s . credit rating agencies so long to act . "" the rating agencies are at fault here for waiting so long and thinking they could hold the deal together , "" said tom burnett , a director of merger insight , a research and analysis firm . "" that ' s not their job . there ' s not one new piece of information available today that wasn ' t available last week .

"" there was talk in the markets that the absence of official statements from dynegy and enron ( on ) tuesday should have been taken by the rating agencies as a clue that the merger was about to fall apart .

"" you ' re hoping you are going to be able to do the business ( done formerly on enrononline ) . that was a usable platform and it was easy to trade at any time - it was an around - the - clock system . that is going to dry up , "" a new york broker said . houston - based enron said it indefinitely suspended future operation of enrononline on wednesday . u . s . and european traders said it closed down shortly after standard & poor ' s cut the financially troubled houston - based company ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status . now , base metal markets could be poised to lose , at least temporarily , a degree of liquidity during off - hours , after the new york mercantile exchange and london metal exchange close in the afternoon .

"" if after - hours trading in ( base ) metals is something that their customers want to see on the ice system , then they ' ll look into seeing how they can implement it , "" the spokesperson for atlanta - based ice said .

"" enron is in some ways the victim of its own success , "" said gerald keenan , lead energy strategy partner at pwc consulting , part of . "" all this wouldn ' t have occured if the market wasn ' t deregulated . "" enron was one of the earliest and most aggressive advocates of power deregulation , which breaks down traditional utility monopolies by letting customers choose their electricity provider , banking on competition to drive down prices . its aggressive strategies gave enron 20 percent of the north american electricity and natural gas market , and enron was ranked no . 7 on fortune magazine ' s list of the biggest u . s . companies . the downfall but in recent weeks , enron ' s credit and debt spiralled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused its investors to lose faith . the partnerships , which included top enron executives , are the subject of a u . s . securities and exchange investigation . in a fluid , competitive marketplace , punishment comes quickly . enron ' s share price closed at 61 cents on wednesday , down $ 3 . 53 , or 85 percent , from a peak of over $ 90 in august 2000 , after the top three u . s . rating agenices downgraded enron to junk status . "" there are winners and losers in deregulated markets and people who champion them are not necessarily those who will be around in the end , "" keenan said . as more business and mounting profits fell into enron ' s hands , the company took on a air of invicibility . despised by some market players , many of its trading partners nevertheless were willing to go out on a limb because of enron ' s good reputation , smart traders , and high - flying share price . enron ' s core business of trading electricity and natural gas relies highly on creditworthiness , and much of its trading was backed by a corporate guarantee , a kind of standby iou . once that credit guarantee began to be be doubted , credit managers pulled the fire alarm and reduced their exposure . "" up to about two months ago , an enron corporate guarantee was seen by many as money in the bank . then the whole house of cards came down , "" keenan said . people began looking at enron more closely , especially since october when a series of negative disclosures about the company ' s finances forced the company to lower its reported earnings by $ 600 million over the last four years as a result of questionable off - balance sheet transactions . enron ' s trading business - its crown jewel - has also suffered from lower volumes as wary trading partners shifted business away from the cash - poor and credit - threatened enron . what now ? if enron ' s fallout has a significant affect on the regulated companies it did business with , regulators and policymakers could slow down the pace of power deregulation . but if the damage is confined to the wholesale trading market , there will not be as much impact , analysts said . so far , 23 states and the district of columbia have moved to deregulate their retail power markets , although nearly one third of them have delayed the onset of competition partly due to california ' s failed free market experiment . analysts also said if enron is no longer a major player in the large customer market , where it has been very effective , deregulation is not likely to proceed as quickly .

( ene ) and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) is going to hurt , no doubt . but before discussions of "" systemic risk "" and other doomsday scenarios gain too much of a foothold , it ' s worth pointing out that the enron mess is no long term capital management . the death of the enron - dynegy deal is probably tantamount to the demise of enron , too . and that eventuality , should it come to pass , is going to have repercussions beyond one or two energy - trading companies . so it ' s fair enough that this news pulled down stocks of all kinds wednesday . yet the deal ' s demise and troubled enron ' s likely subsequent fate isn ' t a call on the broader value of stocks , whose fortunes remain tied to other fundamentals ( more on this later ) . the bottom line : a major corporation with about $ 62 billion of assets seems destined to fail . in some ways enron could indeed end up being like the implosion of hedge fund long term capital management , since so much of enron ' s assets are involved in trading . and it ' s for sure that the still relatively new industry of trading energy commodities like gas and oil - the so - called merchant energy business - is in shock and will have to regroup . stepping back a bit from the energy business , some big - name banks and other firms may end up with some bad debts if enron ends up in bankruptcy , as most industry observers now expect . individual investors , including mutual - fund holders unlucky enough to own some power - company shares , will also take a hit , as will some pension funds . all told , holders of enron stock have lost more than $ 60 billion this year , with the stock down more than 99 % . but the enron - dynegy deal ' s undoing , while painful and headline - grabbing , is not about to endanger financial markets across the globe , and there is where the analogy to a failed hedge fund thankfully breaks down . even at the epicenter of the enron debacle , there ' s no systemic risk : other merchant energy traders are already saying they ' ll be able to adjust , and s & p said in a conference call wednesday afternoon that it didn ' t expect to downgrade firms similar to enron . in fact , the biggest risks to stocks remain the same as they were yesterday or last week or last month . they ' re fundamentals unrelated to what ' s going on at enron , whose problems started with questionable off - balance sheet transactions . key among those risks , ironically , is stocks ' recent good fortune , which has driven share prices back up to levels that are unsustainable if history is any guide . this is big concern for technology shares but a host of other sectors , too . here ' s proof from elsewhere in wednesday ' s news : gap shares may be trapped near their 52 - week low , but according to prudential securities , which lowered its rating on gap to sell , they ' re still trading at 93 times projected 2001 earnings . another fundamental worry for stocks is the consumer economy , whose health is being hampered by the rising unemployment rate . u . s . payrolls , beefed up like never before during the 10 - year economic expansion , will be pared plenty more . fired people - or those who fear that fate - spend less and certainly pull back on equity investments . a third fundamental that will continue to weigh on stocks is the uncertainty about when exactly corporate earnings will return to meaningful growth . while companies of many stripes have begun to talk about bottoming out , when exactly they ' ll start to see real revenue gains again isn ' t clear . but you can bet that fundamental no . 2 ( the consumer economy ) is a factor here , and until revenues and thus earnings start advancing again , fundamental no . 3 ( share price valuations ) are also at risk . as for the enron debacle , bankruptcy might be the only way out . dynegy will probably have to cough up some money for breaking up the deal and cover some credit exposure to enron ( though it also stands to gain a natural gas pipeline owned by enron ) . chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , which owns just over a quarter of dynegy and which also injected cash into enron , might have to kiss that money goodbye . houston might also suffer , as it ' s the home of both enron and dynegy . but the enron story is , despite all the headlines , a relatively contained one , and the challenges and risks for the rest of the stock market haven ' t changed . - by gene colter , dow jones newswires 201 . 939 . 2068 e : mail : gene . colter @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . in the money : enron trades heavily off the nyse by carol s . remond 11 / 28 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) a dow jones newswires column new york - ( dow jones ) - numbers often speak volumes . or in the case of enron corp .

"" enron said wednesday afternoon that it was "" reviewing "" that claim in an apparent effort to keep dynegy from taking ownership . but even if dynegy does take control of the pipeline , the credibility of top dynegy managers , such as ceo chuck watson , will have been hit hard . if it turns out that dynegy does suffer badly from an enron crash , investors will complain that they should ' ve been told about the vulnerability much earlier . and if dynegy was too tied in to enron ' s fortunes , serious questions about watson & co . ' s risk management skills will be raised . kenny norton the ratings agency downgrades are doubly damaging for enron because rating agencies played a critical role in efforts to shore up the houston company . some observers , noting the steep discount on enron bond prices , had criticized the agencies ' reluctance to downgrade enron debt . but s & p and moody ' s said they wanted to see if the dynegy offer would revive enron . of course , as enron ' s core operations continued to sputter even after the deal was agreed to , the rating agencies ' position looked increasingly untenable . inevitably , if the deal doesn ' t go through and enron implodes , some people will blame s & p for enron ' s demise . s & p analyst todd shipman replies : "" we have always promised people that we wouldn ' t overreact , and i don ' t think we have overreacted . "" he adds that the turning point came when the rating agency stopped believing dynegy and others could revise the deal terms and find cash in time to stop the deterioration in enron ' s business . also , he doubted whether those working to salvage the merger would come up with the sort of provisions needed to keep enron viable . dynegy abandons enron deal shares of energy trader plunge , bankruptcy looms cbsmarketwatch . com lisa sanders 11 / 28 / 01 enron shares ( ene ) closed at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , having lost as much as 85 percent of their value on the day and having collapsed from a 52 - week high of almost $ 85 just 11 months ago . the company lost around $ 2 . 6 billion worth of market capitalization from tuesday to wednesday . close to 342 million enron shares had changed hands wednesday by the close , and the stock broke the all - time volume record of 309 million shares set by intel on sept . 22 , 2000 . dynegy ( dyn ) shares lost $ 4 . 92 , or 12 percent , to $ 35 . 97 . saying in a conference call that it had to "" protect "" its shareholders , dynegy announced it had terminated its agreement with enron , citing "" enron ' s breaches of representations , warranties , covenants and agreements in the merger agreement , including the material adverse change provision . "" company - specific problems ? dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson said : "" some of the best deals are the ones that don ' t get done . "" "" while it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties , this does not reflect a failure of the energy merchant business , "" he said . dynegy president and chief operating officer steve bergstrom said that energy traders have had weeks to prepare for enron ' s diminished role in the business and that the industry has suffered "" no degradation , "" as he put it . "" there has been a clear flight to quality , and it ' s occurring as we speak , "" bergstrom said . "" dynegydirect is a highly scalable platform . "" dynegydirect is a platform much like enron ' s flagship enrononline , which it turned off wednesday and which just a month ago was the largest online energy - trading platform , accounting for an average of $ 3 billion in trades a day . dynegy ' s trading exposure to enron is $ 75 million , and the company is no longer trading with its embattled former merger partner and fellow houston industrial giant , bergstrom said . "" dynegy ' s customer - based , asset - backed energy delivery network has been the driver of our 45 percent compounded annual growth rate for the past 16 years and will continue to provide us with earnings sustainability and future growth . "" watson said . as part of the deal , dynegy had the option to keep northern natural gas , enron ' s highly valued natural - gas pipeline , even if the agreement were terminated . the company said during the call that it would exercise that option . chevrontexaco ( cvx ) , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , originally gave $ 1 . 5 billion to the company in the transaction . dynegy used the money to purchase 100 percent of the preferred shares of northern natural gas . enron has 180 days from the date the merger agreement was signed , nov . 9 , to repurchase the pipeline system , watson said . enron said in a statement that it was reviewing dynegy ' s claim of rights to northern . enron representatives did not participate in the call , and dynegy executives said they had been advised against the customary practice of taking questions . enron said it has temporarily suspended payments "" other than those necessary to maintain "" its core energy businesses and added that it is exploring options to keep those operations alive . "" to do this , we will work to retain the employees necessary to the continuing operations of our trading and other core energy businesses , "" said enron chairman and ceo ken lay . enron told employees their questions would be answered in due course and they would receive their paychecks on friday . analysts said the next step for enron would likely be a bankruptcy filing . "" chapter 11 is not the worst of all worlds by any means , "" said john olson , a houston - based energy analyst . "" the key to salvaging the business is the level of debtor - in - possession financing they can get to allow them to trade in some realistic fashion . "" dip financing takes precedence over all other claims , he said . "" the equity people are now at the very bottom of the barrel , and the only people lower than them are [ the people who filed ] the stockholder suits , "" olson said . in a note to clients , analyst michael heim of a . g . edwards said that enron , without dynegy , has "" no value . "" "" enron . . . will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly , "" heim said . "" unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price , there are no hard assets to salvage . "" ahead of this news , s & p cut enron ' s rating to b - minus , or junk status , from bbb - minus , which is the lowest investment - grade rating . the rating agency said that the move reflects "" concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications . "" moody ' s made its announcement of a rating cut to b 2 from baa 3 and said that enron ' s debt remains under review for additional downgrade . in its report , moody ' s cited the likelihood of a dynegy - enron breakup , fueled by enron ' s declining financial performance , as the reason for the downgrade . "" moody ' s . . . baa 3 rating was predicated on good prospects for completion of the merger with dynegy and reasonable prospects for marginally investment - grade characteristics of the merged entity , "" moody ' s wrote . "" furthermore , lack of confidence in enron by its trading counterparties appears to be adversely affecting enron ' s core trading operations . "" for enron to survive , the credit agency said , it ' s imperative that the volumes from the trading business remain profitable . fitch , which had rated enron bbb - minus , lowered the rating to cc , which "" indicates that default of some kind appears probable . "" the u . s . treasury is keeping an eye on the impact the enron fallout is having on the credit markets , spokeswoman michele davis said wednesday . "" we are monitoring credit markets as we do every day , "" davis said . "" markets always fluctuate and we haven ' t seen anything extraordinary . "" treasury said that outside its surveillance of credit markets , it would refer any inquiries on energy trading to the federal energy regulatory commission or the commodity futures trading commission . earlier in the day dynegy , which had originally offered to buy enron for $ 9 billion in stock , confirmed tuesday that the two companies were discussing a new deal structure , and it said ahead of the credit - ratings and eventual termination news wednesday that discussions were continuing . "" i ' m not aware of any changes in any status of the merger , "" dynegy spokesman john sousa said before the s & p announcement . the merger agreement contained a material adverse - affect clause that , if triggered , allowed dynegy to walk away from the deal . the decline in enron ' s stock price and information contained in the company ' s 10 - q filing of nov . 19 could had activated the clause , but olson said the s & p downgrade clearly fit the description of a material adverse affect . also wednesday , ubs warburg and rbc capital cut their ratings on enron , to "" hold "" from "" strong buy "" and from "" strong buy "" to "" buy - speculative , "" respectively . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . citi , morgan sink on enron exposure cbsmarketwatch . com 11 / 28 / 01 greg morcroft new york ( cbs . mw ) - - j . p . morgan and citigroup shares fell wednesday as investors fretted about the banks ' exposure to troubled energy trader enron . enron shares collapsed after dynegy abandoned plans to buy the largest u . s . energy trader and standard & poor ' s cut its rating on the company to junk bond status . j . p . morgan chase ( jpm ) fell $ 2 . 30 , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 37 . 50 . fellow bank stock citigroup was the second biggest dow loser , dropping $ 2 . 75 , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 47 . 80 . both firms have served as lenders and advisers to the embattled enron , which today saw its debt rating cut to junk status and its would - be acquirer dynegy walk away from the deal . early afternoon calls to citigroup were not returned , and a j . p . morgan spokesman declined to comment on reports of the bank ' s exposure to the situation . the wall street journal reported that both banks were attempting to finance dynegy ' s proposed purchase of enron , and had each committed roughly $ 700 million to $ 800 million in the form of various loans , about half of which were unsecured . the report noted the banks had also committed an additional $ 250 million in equity investments . enron deal falls apart enron ( ene ) shares ended the day at 61 cents , having lost as much 85 percent of their value . dynegy ( dyn ) shares closed down 12 percent at $ 35 . 97 . in a report wednesday , rating agency s & p cut enron ' s rating to b - minus , or junk status , from bbb - minus , which is the lowest investment - grade rating . the rating agency said that the move reflects "" concerns about the viability of the merger agreement with dynegy and liquidity implications of the possible failure of that transaction . the ratings are placed on creditwatch with developing implications . "" shares could be worthless analyst michael heim at a . g . edwards said the downgrade of enron ' s debt by standard & poor ' s "" kills any chance of a deal "" with dynegy . he believes dynegy will have no problems using the debt downgrade to walk away from the deal without paying a break - up fee . "" without a deal , enron has no value , in our opinion , and will most likely be declared bankrupt shortly , "" heim explained in a note to clients . "" unlike other bankruptcies in which a stock continues to trade at a low price , there are no hard assets to salvage . "" he added the s & p downgrade will force enron to accelerate a debt payment of $ 3 . 9 billion , making it virtually impossible for enron trades to interact with most counterparties . u . s . bancorp piper jaffray estimated that enron represents about $ 500 million exposure to citigroup and $ 300 million to j . p . morgan chase . "" n our judgment , these credit facilities are well - collateralized , "" the firm said in a note , anticipating that non - performing assets would increase by $ 440 million at citi in the fourth quarter and $ 300 million at j . p . morgan , reflecting an enron bankruptcy . greg morcroft is new york news editor of cbs . marketwatch . com . at enron , best lay plans go awry commentary : from cabinet prospect to bankruptcy cbsmarketwatch . com 11 / 28 / 01 by david callaway san francisco ( cbs . mw ) - - for ken lay , the collapse of enron corp . goes beyond one of the largest and swiftest corporate meltdowns in u . s . history . it represents the destruction of a lifetime of work that until only three months ago had the texas business leader and political rainmaker perched at the top of the corporate world , the most powerful energy mogul in history and an advisor to the president of the united states . it was less than a year ago that the 59 - year - old lay was being touted as incoming president bush ' s top choice to be treasury secretary , or at the very least , energy secretary . he ranked no . 36 on a list of the 50 best ceos last year published by worth magazine , after having put together a 240 percent return on shareholder value in enron ( ene ) stock over the last three years . enron ' s market value rose from $ 2 billion in 1985 , when lay created the company through a merger of two texas natural gas firms , to more than $ 80 billion earlier this year . but all of that power and prestige came crashing down over the last few months , culminating wednesday in a complete collapse of enron ' s shares in reaction to news that rival dynegy ( dyn ) would not step in to rescue the failing company . when the dust settled , enron ' s shares stood at 61 cents each , its total market value at $ 454 million . see full story . lay and enron now face an almost certain chapter 11 filing , which would be the biggest in u . s . history , and a slew of lawsuits as well as a federal investigation into how they built a tangled web of derivative trades and energy businesses into the empire that it was . a power broker unplugged now lay , a behind - the - scenes string puller in the corridors of power for more than a decade , will find out just how loyal his friends are , starting with bush . lay is a close friend of the bush family and has been one of the largest contributors to the president ' s political campaigns for president and texas governor . enron has pumped more than half a million bucks into bush ' s coffers over the years , including $ 100 , 000 for last year ' s presidential campaign , which was matched by lay and his wife . lay hired former cabinet members james baker and robert mosbacher after they left their positions with the cabinet of bush ' s father , george bush , in the early 1990 s . and with his political largesse came the benefits . lay had vice president cheney ' s ear earlier this year when cheney was presiding over the establishment of bush ' s energy policy , a process cloaked in secrecy that even today cheney refuses to shed light on . in may , he found himself in hot water after the new york times reported that lay called curtis hebert , then chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission , and offered his support if hebert would change his views on electricity deregulation and embrace bush ' s push for retail energy competition . hebert said he refused , and had the impression his job was in jeopardy . lay later denied that he had threatened hebert ' s job security . whatever the case , hebert was later replaced as chairman of the agency by patrick wood , chairman of the texas public utility commission . lay was more successful in his adopted hometown of houston , where he was able to convince gov . bush to deregulate the state ' s electrical markets in 1999 and where , earlier this year , the houston astros began playing in their new stadium , enron field . that lay is a remarkable executive and power broker is without question . he took a rinky - dink natural gas company and in just over 16 years turned into the mightiest energy empire in american history , virtually inventing a new energy market , which enron itself controlled . bill gates would have been proud of the monopoly . but the speed with which the empire collapsed and the shambles that is left suggest that , at best , enron was not much more than an elaborate hedge fund that bet too much on itself . and now ken lay , rainmaker , has fallen back to earth . david callaway is executive editor of cbs . marketwatch . com",Safe Email

I downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that I received today. Then though I tried to build them. I started by trying the w3 program. I used the following lines which produced some strange results. Would any one be able to set me straight?./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/ local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url That worked fine so I moved to the next step. make At the bottem of the text I got the following messages: Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255 make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp' make: *** [w3] Error 2When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems. In saying that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are the commands I used. ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url followed by the commands make and make install. There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.Thanks againDarragh ----- Original Message ----- From: ""Hunt, Bryan"" To: ; Cc: Sent: Thursday, September 05, 2002 5:08 PM Subject: OT: RE: [ILUG] Newby to Linux looking for information on cvs > > speaking of that IDE (weblogic developer) the open source version called > eclipse is free from eclipse.org If you are doing java development you > need to get this IDE .

FINDING QUICKER SOLUTIONS AND SOLVING 
  PROBLEMS QUICKER
Â 
When you are fully booked and
overloaded 
  with work there are still the possibility to use theÂ ancient mental 
  working methods, used by successful people,Â instead of the risk for 
  stress and burn out problems.
Â 
These ancient methods for shortening 
  waiting time, adding power to a quicker decision, eliminating stress and
the 
  risk for burn out, are not so commonly used, despite the methodsÂ are 
  known from ancient time.
Â 
The power in the mental working
methods 
  claim for no extra energy consumption so the body will not get tired,
stressed 
  or burn out.
Â 
Please check the web
site:
www.scaninvent.com/mental.methods
Â 
In the compendium I, the
undersigned,Â will 
  reveile and explain my own methods - how I learned them and how I am
training 
  and exercizing them as well as the tactics in converting inner knowledge
to 
  outer reality the speediest way ever known.
Â 
You are most wellcome to study these 
  methods.

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
clunky interface.Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop?Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:http://www.botspot.com/best/12-09-97.htm--

Ah.  Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled 
down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the 
blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said 
it's a simple resource change.Ted's code to ""ketchup"" made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization.  I've fixed it up... almost 
and it looks like this now:proc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh mhProfile msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Sequence $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) ]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem <= $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}
The ""almost"" is because it's not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc.  I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free.Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that 
my sequences are ... cluttered.--Hal

are better than before).score INVALID_MSGID                  1.226
score MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA            1.696
score MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA_2          0.532Total of 3.5 which is better than 7.4, I suppose.If they fixed their MSGID, it would help.  I suppose we could allow
comments without hurting spam detection too much, but I'm reluctant
(it's pretty bizarre to put a comment after the Message-ID header).Can you open a bugzilla ticket for this one?Dan

12132,"available for review : phonology the three books listed below are in the linguist office and now available for review . if you are interested in reviewing a book ( or leading a discussion of the book ) ; please contact our book review editor , andrew carnie , at : carnie @ linguistlist . org note : please include in your request message a brief statement about your research interests , background , affiliation and other information that might be valuable to help us select a suitable reviewer . do not provide a link or url to an online cv or homepage - - these will be ignored . please also provide a surface address for us to send the book to . phonology : james m . scobbie ; autosegmental representation in a declarative constraint - based framework 0-8153 - 1949 - 0 , cloth ; 280 pages , $ 61 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics the book examines the formal characterization of multiple association from the perspective of a declarative constraint-based phonological framework . both the autosegmental and constraint-based aspects of the book are highly relevant to recent developments in phonological theory , predating the current interest in constraint interaction and optimization . inspired by the empirical and formal success of unification - based grammars , all phonological rules and representations are interpreted as hard constraints on well-formedness . in general then , constraints are simply conjoined , and faithfulness to the lexical entry is obligatory . alternations arise from underspecification . the multiple sequenced tiers of autosegmental phonology are shown to be redundant , and linear order is limited to the root tier . association is then defined as the inverse of dominance within the feature geometry , so multiple association is co-dominance of a feature by two roots . the no crossing constraint is not applicable since non-root features are not on sequenced tiers , and the sharing constraint is introduced instead as the key means of forcing locality on co-dominance : it bans co-dominance by non - adjacent roots . thus , because features and association lines are indestructible , the key autosegmental properties of integrity and inalterability are predicted to occur . long distance dependencies are then considered . from the perspective of structural integrity , discontinuous geminates in planar morphologies are more like fake geminates than true geminates , which is predicted by the sharing constraint . only a tiny amount of nontonal data can be presented in favor of non-local multiple association which feeds phonological rules : chaha displays non-local inalterability and javanese , the opposite ( side-effects ) . thus the balance of evidence is against a single mechanism uniting local and non-local multiple association . phonology daniel silverman ; phasing and recoverability ; 0-8153 - 2876 - 1 , cloth ; 256 pages , $ 56 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this phonological study investigates the articulatory timing ( "" phasing "" ) relationships that render acoustic cues optimally recoverable by the listener , and the strong tendency for languages to allow sub-optimal timing patterns only if they allow optimal ones . the primary area of focus is the otomanguean language group of oaxaca , mexico and neighboring states , which possesses "" laryngeally complex "" vowels , a typologically unusual pattern in which tone and non-modal phonatory settings ( breathiness , creakiness ) cross-classify . the laryngeally complex vowels of jalapa mazatec , comaltepec , chinantec , and copala trique are studied in depth . also explored are the phasing relations between obstruents and laryngeals , and sonorants and laryngeals , including phonological analyses from such diverse groups as mon - khmer , tibeto - burman , and nilotic , among others . throughout the investigation , findings from a number of relevant disciplines aerodynamics , acoustics , audition are applied to the sound patterns in an effort not only to describe them in phonetic detail , but also to explain their phonological and typological behavior . ( ph . d . dissertation , university of california - los angeles , 1995 ; revised with new bibliography and index ) phonology burquest , donald a . , author ; phonological analysis : a functional approach ; pb ; isbn : 1-55671 - 067 - 4 ; x + 314 pp . , 1998 , 2nd ed . , $ 29 . 00 . summer institute of linguistics . human language is a remarkable phenomenon . its study continues to be a source of fascination and delight . dr . donald burquest , professor of linguistics at the university of texas at arlington , developed this foundational textbook during years of helping students overcome the feelings of dismay that new phonology students experience when confronted by a mass of raw phonetic data . while working through the material , the student is led through the steps of organizing data and is introduced to particular theories for later in-depth specialization . the author expands on the previous edition of this text by adding introductions to autosegmental phonology and metrical phonology . he has also included a series of problems at the end of most chapters that provide an opportunity for the student to apply the information in that chapter . this textbook is intended for use in an upper division introductory course in phonology , preparing the student to further study aspects of current theory .",Safe Email

8154,"re : business offer dear sir , greetings , i am mr . henry okoye the account manager of mr . ziya bazhayev in standard trust bank regional office in victoria island , here in lagos . however i got your contact through the international web directory . i decided to contact you by email because i feel that it is more secured and private . recently we discovered a dormant account with a huge amount of money valued usd 35 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty five million dollars only ) that belongs to one of our late customer who died in a plane crash . during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to mr . ziya bazhayev , president of the oil alliance company who died on yak - 40 aircraft , on a charter flight from moscow to kiev on march 9 , 2000 . the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery of this development . the banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for six years , it will be forfeited to the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill . it is only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this discovery that i decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out this dormant fund . in order to avert this negative development , i on behalf of my trusted colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to our late customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary ? s next of kin now that the bank is still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased , mr . ziya bazhayev . you will read more news about the plane crash on these websites , http : / / www . amarillonet . com / stories / 031500 / usn _ lao 703 . 001 . shtml and http : / / news . 1 chinastar . com / ll / english / 61934 . shtml in fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as civil servants , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of transfer since we still work in this bank , this is the actual reason why we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank a / c immediately to receive this fund , even an empty a / c can also serve for this purpose . on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to 40 % as gratification for your assisting us , and the remaining 60 % will be for me and my partners . what i want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin . i have in my possession , all the necessary documents to successfully accomplish the operation . bear in mind that this proposal is 100 % risk free . further information will be given to you as soon as i receive your positive response . i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish . find in the attachment of my family picture , to proof who i am . i await your urgent responce . regrads , mr . henry okoye",Phishing Email

4446,"california 6 / 13 executive summary - cpuc rules that socal must pay 15 % of debt to qfs ( approximately $ 50 million ) - ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal - voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring - fencing by eix parent - bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report 1 . socal loses cpuc ruling , but retains appeal option as you may have seen , bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted 5 - 0 to force socal to make 15 % of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california . cpuc rules allow 30 days to appeal its rulings , leaving a window open for socal to buy more time . 2 . voluntary filing in ? with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing , the key now is how socal ' s board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors . in other words , sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing . a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily . the recent ring - fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross - default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal . in and of outself , it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing . 3 . involuntary out ? sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal . this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy . sources report that in creditor discussions , there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid . "" people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else , but not the debt holders , "" a source commented . the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place . also , they receive high capacity fees in the summer ( these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees ) . these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling , 4 - year basis and will be re - calculated next year . the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation , incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place . 4 . montali supporting qfs judge montali , by his recent rulings , is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships . he is trying to help them through his rulings . for example , as long as qfs remain on line , those who petition can receive additional payments from pg & e . over a 4 - month period , these payments equal 20 % of the qfs ' pre - petition claims . this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg & e . 5 . ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly "" deeply concerned "" about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us .

significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
those starting with 'x-vm').When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I

    total unique fn 36This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",Safe Email

The cost is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming. Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title (okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and nearly impossible...We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info - which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :( ---------------------------------------------------------------- Sent using Phorum software version 3.2.6",Safe Email

II. BUGTRAQ SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5363
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of
OpenSSL.When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the
client and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies
in the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the
SSLv2 protocol.A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a
malformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in
execution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker
gaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may
result in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of
service condition.The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the
application using OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5345
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345
Summary:Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is
maintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows
operating systems, as well as Linux.A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a
Microsoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a
request such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'
characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request
followed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an
error page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,
potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5347
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347
Summary:dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It
is designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access to the software.This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'
value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,
the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1
and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also
submit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to
1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the
project management system.This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to
authenticate the user.4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5362
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects
SSLv3 session IDs.When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike
exchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with
a unique session ID.Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a
client from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the
remote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,
remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute
malicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5342
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342
Summary:phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and
backended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and
Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a
gender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been
reported in this mod.A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating
their profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this
string, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2
site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,
including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify
additional information stored in the database.6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5354
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354
Summary:shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and
runs on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating
systems.ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via
form fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback
form is not sanitized of HTML tags.Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary
HTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This
may result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a
user who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the
security context of the site hosting the software.This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal
cookie-based authentication credentials.7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5360
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360
Summary:Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and
will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose
the contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is
only present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the
software and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The
source of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity
checking of variables.The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll
version 1.2.Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may
potentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run
in the SYSTEM context.8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5366
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5366
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported in
the OpenSSL ASN.1 library.This vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,
PKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformed
certificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and client
implementations which depend on OpenSSL.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5367
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367
Summary:super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar
functionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux
and Unix variant operating systems.super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to
incorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is
possible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the
vulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due
to an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super
configuration file will still be able to execute code with root
privileges.Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary instructions with root privileges.10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5369
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369
Summary:Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate
uploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should
work with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to
gain access to sensitive information.Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords
contained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain
text. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,
is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for
retrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and
abuse the Eupload service.This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to
protected resources.11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5344
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344
Summary:The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as
'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux
utilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check
for the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under
specific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The
util-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.
Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these
files to elevate privileges.The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific
circumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd
file.Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.
Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,
may also be vulnerable.It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils
package (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.12. OpenSSL Kerberos Enabled SSLv3 Master Key Exchange Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5361
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5361
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system
using SSL version 3.When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are
exchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key
is supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause
a buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory
on the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the
attacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to
execute malicious, attacker supplied code.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5364
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5364
Summary:OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.Remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported in
OpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds with
regards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It is
possible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly large
values are submitted by a malicious attacker.Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.14. ParaChat Phantom User Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5370
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5370
Summary:ParaChat is a web-based chatting system.  It is available for most Unix
and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.ParaChat chat servers are prone to a denial of service condition.If a user has left the webpage for a chat room using the Back or Forward
buttons of their browser in lieu of logging out, their account will still
be logged into the chat room until it times out 15 minutes later.  A
malicious user may do this repeatedly as different users to overload the
chat server with ""phantom"" users.  A denial of service may be the result.15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5374
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM

http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374
Summary:OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server
protocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised
recently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the
source code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the
openssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July
31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say
that the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan
process is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed
the trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan
will then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified
address is attempted once every hour.'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan
to respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly
probable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable
systems.The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following
is the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5
(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57The following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports

BugTraq ID: 5375
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5375
Summary:Gallery is an open source web based photo album. It is written in PHP and
is available for Linux and Unix variant as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.Gallery is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include
arbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present in the
following PHP script files provided with Gallery: errors/configmode.php
errors/needinit.php errors/reconfigure.php errors/unconfigured.php
captionator.phpAn attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a file, 'init.php', on
a remote host as a value for the 'GALLERY_BASEDIR' parameter.If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of
attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.
Successful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.17. John G. Myers MUnpack Malformed MIME Encoded Message Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5385
Remote: No
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5385
Summary:John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for munpack 1.5.
Reportedly, it is possible to cause munpack to crash when it receives a
malformed email or NNTP news article.As this vulnerability is the result of a buffer overflow condition, it may
be possible for an attacker to cause munpack to execute malicious attacker
supplied code. This has not, however, been confirmed.18. Dispair Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5392
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5392
Summary:Dispair is a web-based .tar.gz archive viewer.  It is written in Perl and
is available for Linux and Unix operating systems.Dispair fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied input before it is
passed to the shell via the Perl open() function.  A remote attacker may
exploit this condition by injecting arbitrary commands into CGI parameters
in a request to the vulnerable script.The result of successful exploitation is that attackers may potentially
exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell
with the privileges of the webserver process.19. Mailreader Session Hijacking Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5393
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5393
Summary:Mailreader is an open source project which allows POP3 mail access through
a web interface. Mailreader is implemented in Perl, and should work under
Microsoft Windows, Linux and other Unix based operating systems.A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Mailreader. It may
be possible for a remote attacker to hijack the session of a legitimate
user of the system. This may result in access to sensitive information, or
the ability to send mail and otherwise function as the legitimate user.Full exploit details are not available. It is possible that this
vulnerability results from session information being tracked through CGI
parameters, which may be trivially spoofed by a remote user. This
possibility has not, however, been confirmed.20. John G. Myers MPack/MUnpack Malformed Filename Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5386
Remote: No
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5386
Summary:John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.A vulnerability has been reported for mpack/munpack 1.5. Reportedly, it is
possible to cause munpack to create files outside of a designated
directory. When mpack/munpack receives a MIME encoded message with an
attachment that refers to a file, using a '../' sequence followed by the
filename, it may decode the attachment outside of a designated directory.The impact of this vulnerability is limited as it has been reported that
munpack will only accept a single '../' sequence and will not overwrite
any existing files.21. Fake Identd Client Query Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5351
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5351
Summary:Fake Identd is an open source Ident server designed to return the same
information to all incoming requests. It is implemented by Tomi Ollila,
and available for Linux and a number of other Unix based operating
systems.Reportedly, some versions of Fake Identd fail to properly handle long
client requests. A specially formatted request split across multiple TCP
packets may cause an internal buffer to overflow. Reportedly, execution of
arbitrary code as the Fake Identd server process is possible.Fake Identd is designed to drop privileges. However, it has also been
reported that this behavior is flawed in some versions. As a result,
exploitation may result in the execution of code with root privileges.

compatibility library. The only problem I have with some rpm 4.1 versions
is that it sometimes hangs at the and of operations (-e, -i, -F or -U) and
the only workaround is to kill it, ""rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__*"" and try again.Matthias--

GAB> I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
GAB> infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
GAB> and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
GAB> from making money on advertisements that are deemed
GAB> thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
GAB> government board.  As it was posted to ""discussion"" I
GAB> thought there'd be some.GAB> Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill
GAB> lamenting the fact that some people know how to
GAB> fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
GAB> of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously
GAB> he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups
GAB> get specific ""zones"" and that it's not up to the
GAB> police to decide what messages and signs get put into
GAB> what zones to most expediently keep order.  Oh thats right Greg.  Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush
folks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is
this again?Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.
Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to
be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few
years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy
_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the
pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enough
of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.I'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.
If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably
assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?
Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this
scenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I
falsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.
End of story.GAB> The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
GAB> nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
GAB> political rallies that you don't agree with has become
GAB> common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
GAB> that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
GAB> They teach you that your very first year of law school.I'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to
chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting
down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you
question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way.
GAB> I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
GAB> Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
GAB> speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
GAB> every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
GAB> an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
GAB> a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
GAB> that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
GAB> effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. Getting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to
an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How
do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience
without violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was
throwing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause
physical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that
has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has
the option to leave.
Just my .02, while its still considered legal.

2446,"HelloYou may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogenese comme hermeneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interpretation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ?

qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation comme resolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' evolution ? * si , comme dans la deuxieme definition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours deja signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ?

Hello, 
Premium Phone Qualified 
Business Opportunity Leads
If you're spending money marketing a Business Opportunity or MLM,
you will definitely be interested in 
what we have to offer you. 
You're tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having 
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.Â  Sometimes
calling 100 people without one single signup!Â  Sometimes 
talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches
to the point of them hanging up when you call!Â  (Leads oversold)
We're here to help! 
We'll get you qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity. 
Period. 
No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. 
We'll do it quickly, and professionally. 
And we won't ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results!Here's How We Generate Our Leads...
- All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!
- One source we use for Lead-generation is a Business Opportunity
Seeker Lead List of people who have requested info. about making 
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.Â  If they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.
- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following 
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
Name:
Email:
Phone:
Best time to call:
State:
Reason they want to work from home!:
How much they want to make per month:
How much time they can commit per week:
How much money they have available for startup:
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, 
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time* 
(only minutes old).Â  Never more than 24 hours old.Â  Guaranteed!
- We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name, 
Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when
the Lead was generated!Â  However, almost ALL leads will have
ALL of the information asked above.Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:
1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the 
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. They are Super-Fresh!Â  Delivered in Real-Time only moments 
after they are contacted and qualified!Â  (Not 30-120 days old)
3. They're Targeted.Â  Each Lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. They're Highly Receptive!Â  Receptivity is very, very high 
because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching 
them on opportunities!Â  Also they'll remember speaking to 
someone over the phone.Â  Especially since we tell them to 
expect your call!
5. No ""feast or famine"" activity.Â  Leads will be coming in 
regularly.Â  You dictate the flow!
6. No more cold calls!Â  We tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you 
get with each Lead!
8. Save Time.Â  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.
9. Lower ""burnout"" factor.Â  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier 
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due 
to higher closing ratios.Â  Of course, this builds faster and stronger 
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of 
""quick successes"".
12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. 
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead, 
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.
If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high
quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.Â  Just let us know 
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized 
lead-generation campaign for you. 
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been 
more critical than it is today, why not call us NOW!
These are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't 
just responding to some ""Generic Business Opportunity"" ad, they're 
contacted over the phone specifically for YOUR company!Â  And we 
forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not 
days, weeks, or months!Start Generating As Many SIGN-UPS as You Can Handle!

Date: Not suppliedRob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the

"" the market is really shrugging off this news , "" said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front "" looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , "" mr . kroll said .

"" companies "" are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , "" said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as "" double witching .

I know this isn't big news for most of you, but I'm no longer the first Dave on Google. Maybe someday I will be, again. :-(Â 
Well, yesterday I went for my 30-day post op review (it was actually 38 days after I was discharged) and there was good news and bad news. The good news is that I'm healing quickly. My body is very strong and doing really well. My blood pressure is great. Heart rate is great. Cholesterol needs work and I have to lose a bunch of weight, and of course I can't smoke. Now the bad news. I have to be a saint for the rest of my life. I knew this day was coming. As I start to feel better, I want to relax. That ain't going to happen. Oy. Here's my old theme song. ""Don't ask me to be Mister Clean, cause baby I don't know how."" I need a new song. Oh mama. Â

Thanks to Glenn Reynolds for the link to metsonline.net. As a Mets fan since 1962, I think it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money. The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major League Baseball. If you go deeper you see that Hoch contributed his time for free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.Â 
Postscript: I've been emailing with Bryan, and asked if the local NY press has taken up his cause. He says: ""Not yet. You can help by calling any one of the major metro papers (Post, Daily News, Times, Newsday)."" More.. Ernie the Attorney is looking into this. ""LSU Law School is suing one of its students for trademark infringement over a website that he maintains. The site is called lsulaw.com, and it includes a school calendar, law-related links and comments by Douglas Dorhauer, some of them critical of the law school.""Â

To me it seems obvious that that's slavery."" Â

long-term effects of advanced information technology , soft computing and other related ' intelligent technolgies ' in application fields such as industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition and machine translation . the general aim of the symposia is to address and underline the existing and emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing and intelligent technolgies , with particular emphasis on soft computing . contributions are sought on intelligent automation and manufacturing with emphasis on current and potential applications , with a broad interest in all the engineering disciplines , computer science and related technology fields . following the success of iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) and iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , the third symposium will be held in genova , italy . the iia / soco series have established themselves as a platform for scientists and practitioners from academic , governmental and industrial institutions to discuss new developments and results in the field of intelligent technologies . a further follow-up conference has already been scheduled for the year 2001 in paisley , scotland . purpose of iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 advances in soft computing and related techniques : theory and applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one of the major technological drivers in the advancement of modern society . nowadays any major achievement , related to any field of research , is strongly supported by proper ait based tools . very often , such achievements have only been possible after a proper ait approach has been designed and implemented . it is widely known that ait has a very strong impact on society itself , radically changing the skills and competencies required in order to contribute to the everyday human environment . given that nowadays the major effort in ait development is spent in the so called ' soft - computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition and image understanding the programs of the two conferences will , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below : a ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control and diagnostics - computer vision - robotics and remote sensing - speech recognition and machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics of soco ' 99 soco ' 99 will include contributions on long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) in the area of soft-computing . contributions are sought in areas based on the list below , which is indicative only . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms and intelligent control - pattern recognition and image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases and information retrieval - educational aspects of soft computing special session a special session on ' intelligent systems in control and process optimization ' including a plenary lecture is sponsored by the ifs network and organized by alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location the symposia will be held at the palazzo ducale , a beautiful historic building in the city centre of genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 are sponsored by : -

diary.codemonkey.org.uk [Dave Jones]:
 Got a mail from Neil telling me about some whizzy new warnings in the cvs 
version of gcc. Pulled it and spent a while playing with gcc, and after a 
few false starts got it to spit out a bunch of warnings when compiling the 
kernel. There's a boatload of stuff that still needs cleaning up for 2.5 
(Things like __FUNCTION__ abuse and the like). 2.4 doesn't even compile due 
to broken asm constraints and other such sillies. As 3.x isn't a recommended 
compiler for 2.4, this isn't too important just yet. As more and more archs 
start using 3.x for their standard compiler though, we should clean up some 
of this stuff for 2.5. The new warning Neil tipped me off about 
(-Wunused-macros) turns out far too much crap. From what I looked at, 
it was correct in most cases, and yes there were macros being defined 
but being unused. Cleaning them up however creates a maintenance nightmare 
for anyone with patches in those areas already. (This sort of cleanup 
particularly hurts people like myself who have huge patches touching large 
parts of the tree). The recent gcc->c99 struct initialisers patch for instance 
made large parts of my tree reject. With more to come, the fun isn't over yet either.that is the CVS version, but it seems that more breakage is to come with the
kernel :((Everyone will want to compile their machine on the latest greatest... I think
they eventually persuaded Compaq's compiler to compile the kernel)...L.

How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,
deccy.--

This is something that often annoys me. Programmers can spend hours inlining
code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best
performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm.Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no
sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms.Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small -
such as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most
applications.One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call.
Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of
instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost
saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours.But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline
optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes.- Matthew (who really should be writing code)

"" the events in israel have created a lot of uncertainty , "" said peter coolidge , senior equity trader at brean murray & co . "" that more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front . "" at least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa . on monday , israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat ' s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation . the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u . s . economy , including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 . 9 % in october . robust spending on cars and other big - ticket items contributed to the reading ' s largest jump since 1959 , when the data series began . the previous record had been a 2 . 6 % increase in september 1987 . personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row , roughly in line with economists ' forecasts . the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 . 9 % increase in total construction spending for october . forecasts had that figure falling by 0 . 5 % . september construction spending was revised to show a 0 . 7 % drop from the 0 . 4 % decline previously reported . meanwhile , a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november . the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 . 5 last month from 39 . 8 in october . economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 . a pmi reading of 42 . 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy . so november ' s pmi of 44 . 5 suggests that the economy is growing , albeit slowly . last week , the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march , ending the longest period of economic expansion in u . s . history . the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 . 1 % in the july - september quarter . against this backdrop , analysts called the latest napm data encouraging . "" after absorbing last month ' s aftershock of the terrorist attacks , the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november , "" norbert ore , director of the survey , said in a statement . "" the trend is definitely in the right direction , but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery . based on this report , the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october , "" mr . ore said . matthew freedman , an economist at economy . com , said the napm report "" shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically . "" but the stronger - than - expected numbers did little to comfort investors , who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom . the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending , which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one . most major international markets traded lower monday , but the u . s . economic data helped narrow the losses late in the day in europe . frankfurt ' s xetra dax closed essentially flat and london ' s financial times stock exchange 100 - share finished 0 . 8 % lower . in asia , tokyo ' s nikkei 225 stock average closed with a loss of 3 . 1 % , and hong kong ' s hang seng index dropped 1 . 1 % . meanwhile , the turmoil surrounding energy - trading giant enron continued over the weekend , as the company filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday . the houston firm simultaneously sued its would - be merger partner dynegy for "" not less than $ 10 billion , "" accusing it of wrongful termination of their merger pact . news of the impending collapse of enron had weighed heavily on the market last week . some market participants suggested enron ' s bankruptcy filing - - the largest in u . s . history - - continued to pull stocks lower on monday . but others said it was largely expected and was having little effect on share prices . "" it could hurt the markets somewhere down the road , but i haven ' t heard a lot of people talking about it [ monday ] , "" said mr . coolidge of brean murray . enron shares rose 11 cents to 37 cents . dynegy was down nearly 8 % . financial - services stocks took a hit monday , dragged lower by some negative comments from analysts and fears about exposure to the enron debacle . shares of brokerage firm morgan stanley sank 6 % after goldman sachs analyst richard strauss pulled it from his recommended list and cut his rating on the stock to "" market perform "" from "" market outperform . "" mr . strauss said that the 60 % surge in morgan stanley ' s shares since sept . 20 has made it expensive compared to its peers . citigroup , a component of the dow jones industrials , declined nearly 2 . 7 % and j . p . morgan fell 3 . 8 % . the two companies advised on the failed merger between enron and dynegy and now find themselves among enron ' s largest unsecured creditors . automotive stocks were also trading lower monday as the big auto makers offered up monthly sales results for november . shares of ford motor were down 6 . 1 % on news that it is expected to warn this week that quarterly results will miss forecasts . separately , the company reported a 4 . 4 % increase in total u . s . vehicle sales , helped by 0 % financing offers . ford rival general motors , which has also been offering generous financing plans to lure buyers , reported a 13 . 3 % jump in car and truck sales from a year ago . shares of gm fell 1 . 4 % . in major u . s . market action : stocks fell . on the big board , where 923 . 7 million shares traded , 1 , 804 stocks fell and 1 , 291 rose . on the nasdaq , 1 . 17 billion shares changed hands . bonds rose . the 10 - year treasury note rose more than 1 / 4 point , or $ 2 . 50 for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to price , fell to 4 . 71 % . the 30 - year bond added more than 3 / 8 point to yield 5 . 26 % . the dollar strengthened . it bought 123 . 93 yen and traded at 89 . 14 cents to the euro , compared with 123 . 44 yen and 89 . 65 cents late friday in new york . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dueling enron , dynegy lawsuits start of long battle by janet whitman of dow jones newswires 12 / 03 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - dueling lawsuits filed by former merger partners enron corp .

I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other
description, but not 'lifted'. Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those
societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today.

14076,"linux - - hit or miss ? network world fusion focus : phil hochmuth on linux today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ? 03 / 15 / 00 dear wincenty kaminski , today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ? by phil hochmuth so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating system last year , with a 93 % growth rate over the year before . linux was the second most - shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt , capturing 24 % of new licenses shipped . as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls . but what of the open source hacker  , s dream of  & linux on every desktop ?  8 sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that linux  , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro areas of network servers and embedded operating systems . according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong , analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft  , s antitrust problems and the surging popularity of linux . even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  , s desktop future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  , s future on desktops . dyroff said ,  & given the lack of applications available , we really can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet .  8 a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops . according to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open source operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number jumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 . despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client desktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui ) and available applications . one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according to eazel  , s web site , the company  , s goal is to bring linux to the masses and  & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere mortals .  8 the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will help standardized the look and feel of linux for  & regular  8 users . for enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side , this development will be worth keeping an eye on . on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been available for some time , such as sun  , s staroffice suite and koffice for the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the operating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux care vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this . while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop , there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets in the future . to contact phil hochmuth : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com . for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page : http : / / www . nwfusion . com staroffice software from sun http : / / www . sun . com / staroffice corel linux os http : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm eazel http : / / www . eazel . com gnome - - the gnu network object model environment http : / / www . gnome . org koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop environment http : / / koffice . kde . org / cobalt networks , inc . http : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com progressive systems http : / / www . progressive - systems . com picazo http : / / www . picazo . com other linux - related articles from network world : active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world , 03 / 13 / 00 subscription services to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters , go to : to change your email address , go to : subscription questions ?

 Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P ComputingEndeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFEÂ® software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
of 
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
Technology, Inc. today
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
e-security.Â® This strategic
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing""Endeavors Technology joins the RSA SecuredÂ® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurIDÂ® two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrustÂ® Web access
management, RSA BSAFEÂ® encryption and RSA KeonÂ® digital certificate management.The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""About Magi
Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure

me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the

first place.
Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to 
market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability 
they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was

17125,"tony hamilton / joe carson questions vince , i just wanted to follow - up with you regarding the action items that were taken away from yesterday ' s meeting with you , mike roberts , norma , and myself . 1 ) tony hamilton as you know tony ' s official start date was march 12 , 2001 , and he has yet to receive a paycheck . london ' s pay cycles are different than ours however , and they only get paid on the 20 th of each month . tony did not receive a paycheck on march 20 th because all of his new hire information has to be put into sap ( the payroll system ) by the first of the month for the employee to receive a check on the 20 th . consequently , tony will not receive his first paycheck until april 20 th . if you would like for me to try and work with the london office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that , please let me know . 2 ) joe carson from what i am able to gather , gary hickerson did make joe carson an offer that consisted of a one - year contract . however , gary is out of town until monday , and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal . would you like me to contace joe to find out the specifics , or would it be more acceptable for me to wait until gary returns so that i can get all of the facts . i look forward to working with you . thanks , anne labbe '",Safe Email

This IMHO, goes against the spirit of GPL. 
Thanks for the info.
Is there any distro (pref. Mandrake or failing
that, Red Hat or other) out there for which people 
have disks, are prepared to burn copies and are 
allowed give to me for a small fee?

( better yet , send the students to non-tourist areas of other countries . but i doubt whether the us educational system is prepared for that ! )",Safe Email

Bart Schaefer said:> Just FYI, spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b appears to be the head revision, and is 
> not the same as the tip of the b2_4_0 branch.oops.  OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,
accordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as
the code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0bSo, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that
were not there before the branch:  - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too
    lax and caused FPs  - Matt's faster HTML parser  - commented rules un-commented again  - a doco fix for spamd
and, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:  - the INSTALL file ;)  - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary  - Added examples to -R docs
  
  - Added Habeas HIL lookup  - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.
    -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com
    (Christopher Davis) applied.  -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,
     fixes bug 655  - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file
    with -u arg  - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine  - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been
    improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST  - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D  - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request  - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output  - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users
    will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger
    FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on
    __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.  - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance  - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code
    catch additional types of web bugs  - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid
    Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer
    (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move
    them to the compensation file))  - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html
    were triggering.  - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser  - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing
    any nonspam matches)  - raise some negative scores that are way too low  - remove ""Friend"" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND
    and can match ""dear friend"" in middle of sentence too much  - require ""Dear Friend"" to start the paragraph  - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of
    different eval functions needed for HTML tests--j.--

personal mail is being rejected.  The message is 'No Catalogue Servers
available at this time.'  Since I use razor V1 through Mail::Audit
(using is_spam), I tried several ways to try to trap this error and
allow my mail to be delivered on these occassions but nothing seemed
to work.I started digging through the code and found several uses of exit
inside the razor code.  This is a very anti-social thing for a module
to do.  It takes away my option to bypass the spam check and deliver
the mail anyway.  The razor modules should signal errors through die
or warn.  razor-check could catch these and, knowing it's being called
during mail delivery, issue an appropriate message and exit status for
the MTA.  The razor modules don't know who's calling them and
shouldn't make this decision.  I'm wondering how much legitimate mail
I'm missing because of this.I certainly hope this is being addressed in the new version.--

between those ""in poverty"" and those who
are more affluent than ""working class"".I don't know what poverty officially is,
but from a CA perspective, $15k income is
not going to go far.  At current interest
rates, one would probably want somewhere
around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households.  (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner 
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,
the percentages break down as follows:work\pov.  yes  no

census site.  Anyone have a pointer?):::::::::::> Do you punish the whole industry due to a few bad apples?>>From what little I have heard, the
legislation simply says that lying
in one's public figures is not just
a matter of cheating the accounts,
but really involves stealing time

investors.  How does not tolerating
the bad apples equate to punishing
the good ones?

Date: Not suppliedJohn Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial.

"" the number of class members will be huge , "" says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ? copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c did ken lay understand what was happening at enron ? by floyd norris 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company what a tangled web was weaved by enron . both investors and managers seem to have been misled . ' ' enron became overleveraged , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said this week , adding that things went wrong in ways that ' ' i could not have ever contemplated . ' ' he pointed to investments that ' ' performed far worse than we ever could have imagined . ' ' that was the first time that enron had admitted it had a leverage problem , and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others . mr . lay says he understood what was going on , but i suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by enron ' s soothing financial statements . when enron was riding high , it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants . mr . lay and other executives sold stock , but the company did not . just a month ago , mr . lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company ' s continuing earnings were . the leverage was not easy to find . a lot of it was carried off enron ' s balance sheet . partnerships and special - purpose entities that enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to enron . enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock . as undisclosed losses built up in those entities , it became more likely they could not pay their bills , leaving enron to do so . it is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand enron ' s plight until the last couple of weeks . when they figured it out , it took a $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion that is part of the dynegy takeover to keep enron ' s rating above junk level . now enron has a board committee investigating various transactions , and promises to release details as they are uncovered . officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time , and perhaps they are . jeffrey skilling , mr . lay ' s protege , was enron ' s chief financial engineer until he quit this summer . and enron ' s chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as enron unraveled . some investors would say none of that matters now , that the only important fact is that dynegy is buying enron anyway . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive , is convinced that enron ' s energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price dynegy is paying . he figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained . the big question now may be whether mr . watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study enron ' s trading positions . enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions - - positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet - - but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies . if big surprises are found , dynegy could back out of the deal . there is plenty of blame to go around here , and suits have been filed against enron , its current and former officials , and its auditor , arthur andersen . but investors also bear responsibility . enron ' s financial statements were , as mr . lay conceded this week , ' ' opaque and difficult to understand . ' ' investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on . they bought anyway . enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers . an old - line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world . investors did not care how enron made the numbers . now , when it is too late , they do . graph tracks the monthly closes of enron ' s stock price from 1998 through 2001 . yesterday ' s close : $ 9 . 48 copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a a quick change in fortune dulls the glimmer of houston by jim yardley 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 14 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company houston , nov . 15 - - on a day when oil prices plunged to two - year lows , when the hometown enron corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch , george alcorn lunched on chilean sea bass at the downtown petroleum club and decided that the sky was not falling . ' ' i ' ve been an optimist all my life , ' ' said mr . alcorn , 69 , who owns an independent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid - 1980 ' s . ' ' the opportunities in this town have always been large . i don ' t think it ' s going to change at all . ' ' that mr . alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism . until recently , economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass houston , the nation ' s energy capital . in june , the economist magazine , citing houston ' s increasingly diverse economy , even promoted it as a candidate for the world ' s next great international city and business center . but june is a long time ago . by then , the city had already lost 2 , 000 jobs from the struggling computer maker compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company ' s merger with hewlett - packard is approved . in the aftermath of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , continental airlines , which is based here , announced 12 , 000 layoffs , some likely to come in houston . the texas medical center , one of the largest medical complexes in the world , is facing financial peril after flooding in june caused an estimated $ 2 billion in damages . the latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of enron , the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival , dynegy , was announced last week . even if the merger goes through , the city is expected to feel a crunch ; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction , including one by enron . one visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city ' s sports stadiums , enron field and compaq center , are named for companies that soon may not exist . this week , the national association of purchasing management , which measures business activity and industrial production , released a report showing that houston ' s economy had contracted in october after 32 consecutive months of expansion . ' ' over the first half of this year , you had to feel pretty good , ' ' said bill gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas and an authority on houston . but mr . gilmer said that much of the city ' s recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was ' ' running out of steam . ' ' ' ' the national economy , ' ' mr . gilmer added , ' ' is not helping out right now . ' ' the fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on houston is , oddly enough , evidence of the city ' s success in recovering from the 1980 ' s oil bust . then , with the local economy dominated by oil and gas , the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification . and it worked : compaq , continental , the texas medical center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped houston recover and grow even faster , becoming the nation ' s fourth - largest city . the new generation of sophisticated energy companies , led by enron , then created a boom . economists say the next several months are likely to be slow . there could be substantial layoffs if compaq and enron mergers take place . mr . gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city ' s economy ; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1 , 000 from about 1 , 300 in recent months . yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust , when downtown office buildings stood practically empty . instead , economists point to a relatively quick rebound . ray perryman , a texas economist who runs the perryman group , said houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities , including the city ' s bustling port , the nation ' s second largest . the city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the american entry to be host of the 2012 olympic games . voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line , and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution . ' ' we ' re sitting here with over two million jobs , ' ' said former mayor bob lanier . the downfall of enron , though , a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress , has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city ' s economy . the company had embodied the self - image that houston business leaders hold dear : it was entrepreneurial , aggressive and ground breaking . it was also a generous civic benefactor ; the company ' s chairman , kenneth l . lay , a close friend of president bush , had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate . but this week , enron ' s lost glory became painfully evident . in a hall at rice university on tuesday , mr . lay presented alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , with a lifetime achievement award , the enron prize , which mr . lay ' s company had endowed and named in flush times . the next morning , an article in the houston chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed . photos : compaq center , home of the n . b . a . houston rockets , is named for a company that soon may not exist . enron , above , may soon be acquired by a rival energy company .

( operating cash flow at cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization . ) insurance will cover some of the cost of the johnson - longley payouts . ' ' the team looks healthy , ' ' jim dolan , the president of cablevision , said on tuesday during a conference call with analysts . ' ' i don ' t expect any more write - offs . ' ' whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career - ending injury . but cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of johnson and longley . in each case , the garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods . in his second season in charlotte , johnson hurt his back , and he has never been the same . maybe the garden was swayed that he was well enough , because he averaged 20 . 5 points and 8 . 4 rebounds in the season before it traded anthony mason for him . but the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place . the back compromised his skills , often limiting him to being a symbol of the knicks ' grit . he also spelled ' ' l ' ' with his bended arm quite nicely , yet not worth an average of $ 7 million a year . when longley arrived from phoenix last year in the four - team deal that sent patrick ewing to seattle , he said he had told the knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition . ' ' i brought up my ankle in my physical with the knicks , ' ' he said in july , ' ' and they said , ' have you been playing ? ' i said , ' yes , ' and that was it . ' ' the fact was , he played for the australian olympic team in sydney last year , but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing . should have been a tip - off . the naming rights dance enron field , home of the houston home run , is bound to be called something different next season when jimy williams starts his tenure as the astros ' manager . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , agreed to pay $ 100 million to put its name on the ballpark for 30 years , a deal that began last year . but enron is in trouble . it has lost nearly $ 60 billion in its market value ; the company recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by nearly $ 600 million and it agreed to be acquired by dynergy for $ 9 billion . in another part of houston , the compaq center could take on another name now that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 ( at $ 900 , 000 annually for six years ) is planning to merge with hewlett - packard . in 2003 , the rockets will move to a new arena . named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before . a takeover turned philadelphia ' s comcast center into the first union center . the twa dome in st . louis is now the dome at america ' s center to reflect twa ' s purchase by american airlines . marine midland arena in buffalo now has hsbc ' s name . meanwhile , pro player stadium near miami is named for a defunct division of the bankrupt fruit of the loom . two other n . f . l . stadiums , one being built , the other three years old , are named for ailing companies . in foxboro , mass . , cmgi field is being readied for play next season by the new england patriots . in the 12 months ended july 31 , cmgi , an internet development company , lost $ 4 . 4 billion ( twice the annual network tv payments to the n . f . l . ) . cmgi will pay $ 114 million over 15 years for its naming deal - - if it lasts that long . psinet , an internet communications services provider that is paying $ 105 . 5 million over 20 years to be the name atop the baltimore ravens ' stadium , filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $ 3 . 2 billion in the quarter ending march 31 . the conseco fieldhouse in indiana , the home of the pacers , is named for a finance and insurance company that recently posted a $ 410 million quarterly loss . the financial state of some airlines since sept . 11 may affect some of the arenas and stadiums named for them . besides the dome in st . louis , six other facilities are named for airlines ( two for american ) . last year , the canadian airlines saddledome , where the calgary flames play , changed its name when its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by air canada . now it is the pengrowth saddledome . copyright ? 2000 dow jones fleeing investors have bid the stock down about 90 % from its high last fall . 4 . a blodget blunder ? speaking of folks who lost money for investors , analyst henry blodget is taking part in a buyout at merrill lynch , reportedly exiting the firm with a severance package of about $ 2 million .

"" calgary - - six powerhouse u . s . players are joining transcanada pipelines ltd . and westcoast energy inc . in an attempt to inject new momentum into a bid to build a multibillion - dollar pipeline from alaska . the partnership , which includes energy services and transportation giants williams cos . , duke energy corp . , enron corp . , as well as major utilities el paso corp . , pg & e corp . and sempra energy utilities ventures , have agreed to work together with transcanada and westcoast to put a proposal before the alaska gas producers before the end of the year . the group , which laid out its intentions in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday , said they believe a gas pipeline running along the alaska highway can be built by 2008 . murray birch , senior vice - president of westcoast , said the partners lend expertise , deep pockets and scale to the mammoth project , which is estimated to cost well over $ 10 - billion ( u . s . ) . "" it ' s in our best interest to involve them . this project is a large project , and certainly westcoast and transcanada would have been stretched to do it by ourselves , "" said mr . birch , who is also the co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines ltd . a joint venture co - owned by westcoast and transcanada . foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed alaska highway pipeline . mr . birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still to be worked out . rocco cianco , a foothills spokesman , said that is in part because some of the companies are in a state of flux . westcoast is in the process of being taken over by duke , while houston - based enron is in the process of being bought by hometown rival dynegy corp . the partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participants in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970 s and shelved because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition . mr . birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipeline project , of whether the six u . s . companies had any claim on the project based on their capital investment in the 1970 s project . they withdrew from that project on the understanding that if it was to restart , they would be able to recover that initial investment , which some have pegged at up to $ 4 - billion including interest , he said . in getting back on board , the six companies have agreed to waive that claim , he said . scott kent , the minister of economic development for yukon , a vocal proponent of the proposed pipeline , said the removal of the legal question lifts a huge barrier to the project . "" there was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that would have significantly hampered "" the project , he said . "" it ' s certainly very good news .

"" everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline , there ' s so many ' me toos ' that they just want to position themselves , "" he said . the market understanding is that the alaska producers , which include exxon mobil corp . , phillips petroleum co . , bp amoco plc and chevron corp . , will ultimately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of such a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls . gina taylor , a spokeswoman for enron , said the partners got together with an eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the project can go ahead . "" marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this , "" she said . "" that ' s why we put the [ memorandum ] in place , so we could go out and revisit with the producers . "" but curtis thayer , a spokesman for the alaska producers , said it is too early to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline , because his group has not even decided to proceed with one yet . he noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $ 100 - million study the group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn ' t pay for itself at current commodity prices . however , no decision has been made , he insisted . some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north shore of alaska and yukon to gas fields in the northwest territories , then down the mackenzie valley of the nwt , or a pipeline going over land in yukon to the nwt . there are various backers for each proposal and the alaskan producers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves . joe handley , the minister of finance for the nwt , said news of the partnership is a spur to participants in the proposed mackenzie valley pipeline . the territory ' s government has consistently said an nwt pipeline must be built first or risk being derailed by an alaska pipeline that would flood the market with product .

"" the economic benefits of this multi - billion dollar project would impact most regions of the u . s . and canada , "" said mike stewart , co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines . foothills reached the agreement with transcanada pipelines , westcoast energy and american companies williams , duke energy , el paso corp . , enron , pg & e corp . and sempra energy international . the groups comprise the original alaskan northwest natural gas transportation company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970 s . under the terms of the agreement , the companies plan to dismiss $ 4 billion in costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have been charged to developers of the pipeline . the money represents their original investment , with interest . "" their intention is to remove that as an issue , "" said foothills spokesman rocco ciancio . that was seen as a key roadblock to building an all - alaska pipeline to the lower 48 by officials with the state , which would own 12 . 5 percent of any natural gas pumped out of the north slope . "" now that that ' s been resolved , it ' s time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies , the state of alaska and other players to get this project underway , "" said gov . tony knowles . exxon mobil , phillips and bp have spent millions studying the viability of the project and , so far , have determined it is not profitable . knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to build a route that generally follows the trans - alaska oil pipeline and the alaska highway to alberta . it would provide jobs for alaskans , cheap natural gas to communities and revenues for state services , knowles said . but canadian officials have pushed for a beaufort sea route that taps into rich reserves stranded in the mackenzie delta . the oil companies estimate the canadian route would cost $ 15 . 1 billion compared to the alaska highway route , which would cost $ 17 billion . ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $ 9 . 7 billion to construct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals . the consortium has held permits to build the all - alaska route since 1976 . "" we ' re estimating it would take a greenfield ( start up ) project somewhere near two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project , "" ciancio said . the consortium ' s project proposes running a 42 - inch pipe from prudhoe bay to alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to chicago and san francisco , he said . if agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies , the pipeline could be in operation by 2008 , ciancio said . a spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitable . "" we ' re happy to see efforts being made to support an alaska pipeline project , "" said dave macdowell , spokesman for the oil producer ' s group . "" we ' re absolutely open to folks coming forward with efficient economic projects .

"" while janus again cut sharply into its stake in sun - dropping 14 . 7 million shares - its holdings of cisco and oracle were nearly unchanged in the quarter , the filing showed . janus also cut about 12 . 6 million shares of advanced micro devices inc . . on the other hand , the company added some 13 . 6 million shares of microsoft corp . and boosted its stakes in jds uniphase and ebay inc . . the funds also more than doubled their holdings in berkshire hathaway inc . to 320 , 691 shares . the filing showed that janus made almost no change in the third quarter to its holding of enron corp . , the energy trading company whose stock collapsed amid a u . s . regulatory probe . at the end of the quarter , janus held 41 . 36 million shares in enron . the janus spokeswoman would not comment on the enron shares , but said that the filings are dated and don ' t necessarily reflect current holdings . shares of enron plunged in mid - october as investors rebelled over the company ' s off - the - balance - sheet deals that are now under investigation . enron whose stock is off 63 percent so far in the fourth quarter . the company agreed last week to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock . janus ' s stake in exxon mobil corp . more than doubled to 39 . 8 million shares in the quarter . janus ' s stock holdings were worth $ 102 . 09 billion at the end of the quarter , down from $ 141 . 05 billion at the end of the second quarter . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . cash infusion little comfort to enron counterparties by andrew dowell of dow jones newswires 11 / 15 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - one and a half billion dollars doesn ' t go as far as it used to . despite a cash injection of that size from dynegy inc .

"" it always has been a sort of face - off , "" shipman said . "" for the time being , we ' re standing pat unless the situation at enron gets significantly worse . "" moody ' s wasn ' t immediately available for comment . traders and their companies said consistently that until enron ' s credit ratings improve , they will continue to watch their exposure to enron carefully , with trades limited to short - term deals . mirant corp .

"" the $ 1 . 5 billion has improved their situation with us , and we ' ll keep watching the situation , "" stamm said . on monday , aquila said it had whittled down its exposure to enron significantly . enron spokesman eric thode said 30 - day - moving - average volumes on enrononline , the internet - based trading platform on which enron is the counterparty in every deal , have improved to a more typical 5 , 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $ 2 . 7 billion . "" volumes have returned to the normal range , "" he said . some traders said enron ' s short - term business does appear to have picked up from earlier this week . staffing changes a concern enron is the country ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , accounting for up to a quarter of both markets by some estimates . even when companies aren ' t prohibiting their traders from doing business with enron , some traders are taking steps on their own to limit exposure . one funds analyst said the possibility of staffing changes at enron are contributing to traders ' reluctance to do business with the company . "" you have headhunters out there , "" the analyst said . "" why tie yourself down with a five - year deal with someone who may not be there ? "" enron currently employes about 1 , 500 people in its trading operation , and dynegy employes some 300 . the acquisition is expected to produce cuts , but dynegy hasn ' t said to what degree . energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month , as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75 % drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with distressed debt . enron ' s restatement of four and a half years ' worth of earnings last thursday and ratings downgrades friday led some companies to severely restrict their business with enron , even if that meant paying higher prices or accepting lower bids to do so . enron ' s ability to recover that business is critical to its future , s 201 - 938 - 4430 ; andrew . dowell @ dowjones . com ( john edmiston in houston , jon kamp in chicago and mark golden in new york contributed to this article . ) copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . dynegy may want some of enron ' s broadband assets by erwin seba of dow jones newswires 11 / 15 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) houston - ( dow jones ) - enron corp .

- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. â€œThe best thing about this idea is 
that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both 
users.â€ 
- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release 
for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. 
- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. â€œThe secret to

depends on what you are using to dial. for debian put ""demand"" in
/etc/ppp/peers/. use ""idle 600"" to set the timeout to 10

18629,"Has anybody on the list installed/used this distro? If so wouldn't mind a bit 
of help. Burnt the ISO's from the latest Linux Format magazine. Took a couple of 
attempts to install but got there. My problem - I have a standard dial-up 
modem and the installation gives you the network card setup so internet 
download is out of the question, but, I installed the Stage3 tarball which 
puts the .tgz files on your harddrive.  So methinks, I have the software there and all I need to do is install so as 
1) get the necessary programmes to connect to the net and 2) install any 
other programmes I might need. What actually happens is that if, for example, I attempt to install the KDE 
package, the system goes looking for any dependencies on the net despite the 
fact that the dependencies reside on my hard drive. Obviously I can't install 
anything. Have checked all docs on the web page and nothing deals with a standard 
dial-up modem or how to tell the package manager to look for the dependencies 
on the hard drive. Anybody able to help me here? Thanks in anticipation.--

to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it 
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted 
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. 
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS 
rate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in 
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little 
at a loss I must say.Niall--

17463,"books and articles on cd-rom this text is also available in german ( see below ) dear linguist readers throughout the last years the working conditions of many scientists have been profoundly changed through the introduction of modern data processing technology . almost every workplace is being equipped with a computer which , after hours or even days of patiently getting acquainted with the working procedure of these tools , constitutes an enormous advantage . this advantage especially shows in the ever more efficient saving , processing , and transferring of data . thus , as early as today , most of the manuscripts of books , articles , diplomas , and master 's theses are being processed through word processing programmes and are eventually available as a computer file . besides word processing , both newer , more rapid processors and more efficient programmes also make possible an ever higher integration of images , image sequences and sound recordings into a written text . accordingly , a phonetic transcription of an experiment can contain , in addition to the text , not only a recording of the language but also photographs of the articulating organs , such as mouth and upper jaw . that allows the experiment to be followed much more easily and also to be conducted by other scientists from a different view point . in addition to saving how the research work is done , it is also possible to save the subject of the research on any kind of storage media . in order to archive the amount of data resulting from this particular combination of text , sound and images , the compact disc ( cd ) has come more and more into fashion as the perfect storage medium . today , many publications are already available on cd . besides the possibility of a multi-media presentation of knowledge , the cd has one more advantage : because of the low production costs of a cd and its huge storage capacity , more publications of scientists can be made available than is currently possible in journals and books . at this point , the possibility emerges for young scientists as well as for renowned ones to publish their works that have up to now tended to disappear in some drawer because of either the publishing costs or a "" not-a - chance "" notion . with this as a background , i would like to begin a survey to determine to what extent the linguists of all fields might have interest in the following questions : 1 . ) is multi-media technology commonly accepted ? do linguists prefer traditional print media , or is there any interest in accepting knowledge from the computer screen ? 2 . ) is there any interest in publishing works which contain not only text but also images and sound ? what ideas are there on how to publish these scientific works ? 3 . ) who has experience using cds in the field of linguistics ? this survey is intended to serve as a basis for developing a concept for a new enterprise in the media services sector , which should provide next year 's young linguistically oriented post-graduate students a platform from which to work independently . i would like to thank you in advance for your answers and ideas . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ liebe linguist leser , in den letzten jahren hat sich die arbeitswelt vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert . fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet , der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen des kennenlernens der wirkungsweise dieser geraete , einen enormen arbeitsvorteil darstellt . dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere in der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung , verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten . so werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern , artikeln , diplom - und magisterarbeiten bereits heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich als eine datei vor . neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern , bildsequenzen und tonaufnahmen in eine niederschrift moeglich . so kann z . b . eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachliches experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahmen enthalten , aber auch bildaufnahmen der artikulierenden organe , wie mund und unterkiefer ; damit ist dieses experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfalls durchgefuehrt werden . es ist also moeglich , in vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung , auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger zu speichern . um diese mengen an daten , die durch die kombination von text , bild und ton entstehen , zu archivieren , bewaehrt sich immer mehr die cd als speichermedium . viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf cd . neben der moeglichkeit einer multi - media darstellung von wissen , hat die cd aber noch einen weiteren vorteil : aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer cd und der riesigen menge an speicherplatz wird es moeglich , publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern zu veroeffentlichen , als es mit herkoemmlichen journalen und buechern moeglich ist . hier ergibt sich fuer junge wissenschaftler , aber auch fuer renommierte die moeglichkeit , ihre niederschriften an die oeffentlichkeit zu bringen , die bisher , bedingt durch preis und ` chancenlosigkeit ' , eher in der schublade verschwanden . mit diesem hintergrund versehen , wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten , inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse an folgenden themen zeigen : 1 . ) gibt es eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multi - media technik . greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck , oder besteht auch ein interesse an der wissensaufnahme durch den bildschirm . 2 . ) interessiert sich jemand fuer eine veroeffentlichung eigener arbeiten , die neben text auch bild und ton enthalten . welche vorstellungen gibt es ueber eine solche art und weise der publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten . 3 . ) wer hat schon erfahrungen in der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von cd 's gesammelt ?

Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the

My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my
father's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail
exchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news
came hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:
""Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of
a heart attack at home."" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's
group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like
a beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal
with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone
actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she
had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't
interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see
me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to
Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a
few months ago:
""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at
the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines
last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite
being postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last
minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again
being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this
year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email
publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a
friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their
Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you
get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I
have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.
It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.""
I returned from speaking to another user group the other night and
found that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered.
Sweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized
that Jake was offering his Converting
Vinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was
taking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them
were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a
problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out
the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please
look again). A lot of blood,
sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In
fact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which
probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple
machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use
Dreamweaver.
Which reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly
newsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage
you to give it another glance. After all, as Elwood
Edwards so finely said: You've
Got Lockergnome! Thanks to David
Lawrence for making that MP3 a reality. El can make one with your
name, too. And yes, that's the AOL guy.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

Online BrandingThe Evidence is Against You
Scribbled by Jim GirardEvery time some new technology has expanded free access to popular
music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the
1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it
would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in
increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the
advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including
Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed
by the music industry as different from previous such
developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to
create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual
result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music
industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became
more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD
technology).The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect -
 and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of
songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be
instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the
server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations
playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the
phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused
on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,
and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've
limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win -
 and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to
avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright
is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think
of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,
you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with
the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove
away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be
entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are
aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you
are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for
the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a
copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products
whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like ""Coke"" or
""Kleenex"" as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to
do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of
one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a
great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some
point could start using the word on their own product, arguing
that it is in the public domain.The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually
stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they
know from long experience, increases their sales because most of
the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with
near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the
cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the
cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is
committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the
first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at
establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,
in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a
legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.
The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is
the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music
commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a
few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for
if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to
make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it
requires charging far more for an individual song that most people
are willing to pay.At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of
civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to
the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly
directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and
case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most
technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a
simple moral or criminal issue. ""Common sense"" tells a lot of
people that copying music without paying for it is just like
stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if
common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have
the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual
systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large
part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the
case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those
systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that
most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any
time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an
issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a
matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what
he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you
believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't
be paying him as much as he is.Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about networking? Have you ever wanted to write an e-book?

Smith: ""Here is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail
users who may have trouble opening your links, due to the service
wanting to place the referred URL in a separate frame. I receive
my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful
when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this
isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble
here is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an
error displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click,
copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM),
then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the
control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand;
%3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a
forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark.
The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a
character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the
percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which
translastes into a '&' symbol. Maybe a more clever Gnomie can come
up with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,
correctly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?""Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020712.html

worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot

( attached is a summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if you , or company cfo would like more information about this effort , please contact richard mcmahon , executive director of the alliance of energy suppliers , at rmcmahon @ eei . org , or at 202 - 508 - 5571 . alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25 , 2001 inside washington federal affairs * * * bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee * * * the senate banking committee today approved s 206 , a bill that repeals the public utility holding company act of 1935 . the bill would repeal puhca and transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and appropriate state agencies . s . 206 was approved with two amendments . offered by sen . mike enzi ( r - wy ) , the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy . another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets . * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * * the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association ( appa ) and the large public power council ( lppc ) again has been introduced in the house . the bill ( hr 1459 ) contains the same provisions as were in a measure ( hr 4971 ) , with technical corrections , introduced during the 106 th congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee . hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking , 3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution facilities . the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees , probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal . administration / ferc * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * * president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6 trillion surplus over the next ten years . in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts . it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs , and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2 billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal year 2001 . in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws . * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * * electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy . first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . * commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty : that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together on market structure . the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to do their job . * if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers , * he cautioned , they * will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path . * new generation * * * dynegy to build second plant in kentucky * * * dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to the riverside generating project in lawrence county , kentucky . dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market . commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002 . * * * ppl to expand generation capacity * * * ppl corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near chicago and would increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by 100 megawatts . ceo william hecht said the illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of 2002 . * * * constellation energy group announces eight new plants * * * constellation energy group this week announced that the company is scheduled to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer . additionally , four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers . the four peaking plants are located in illinois , pennsylvania , virginia and west virginia . the larger power plants are under construction in california , florida , illinois , and texas . * we   re building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business , * said constellation energy group chairman and ceo christian poindexter . * * * california energy commission approves construction of otay mesa generating plant * * * pg & e corporation   s national energy group ( neg ) last week announced that the california energy commission ( cec ) has approved construction of the otay mesa generating plant in san diego county , which the neg has developed . the 500 megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1 , 000 homes . after the development process is completed , calpine corporation will assume ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant . neg will contract for up to half the plants output . energy data * * * weekly electric output ( week 15 ) * * * electric output reached 63 , 528 gwh for the week ending april 14 ( week 15 ) , with the highest increase over 2000 levels in the south central states , which both had a 12 . 6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15 . year -

Date: Not suppliedI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.[1] http://www.parentstv.org/

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. =================================================== Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again.

INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ========================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2 . Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 ... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================================= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ======================================================= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net"" Order Report #1 from: A. Christ 1208 Allendale Rd. Mechanicsburg, PA 17055___________________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net"" Order Report # 2 from: Michael P. 2508 Robin Altus, OK 73521 USA ____________________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: ""Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net"" Order Report # 3 from : D. J. 16 Northcrest Dr. London, ONTARIO, CANADA N5X 3V8 __________________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: ""How to Become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM & the Net"" Order Report # 4 from:E. Zurbrigg RR #1 St. Marys, ON, Canada N4X 1C4 ____________________________________________________________ REPORT #5: ""How to Send Out 0ne Million e-mails for Free"" Order Report # 5 from: A. Ebert R. R. #4 Thamesford, Ontario, Canada N0M 2M0____________________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."".

E-Mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com
LAGOS - NIGERIA. ATTN:  
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ""TOP SECRET"".
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. You must however NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below; 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release

10)  Subscription InformationTHE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
===============The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly.The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance.In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts).In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms.  Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable. More information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be
found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.comThe standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  
http://www.iso17799.net SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
====================
The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it.The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  The following are some of the major techniques employed:BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed. EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target.SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc.SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.
There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchangeThe act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA ================
Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm.To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location.That aside, the table makes interesting reading:Argentina 1

STRANGER DANGER
=======
As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again.If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see?The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised.The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized:* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID* Do not leave visitors alone   ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=====================1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total.2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system.3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries.5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods.6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation.CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
======================The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet.  Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year.  We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions:* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases.* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection.* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security!* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means.* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.BSI - CERTIFICATIONS

===============
Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan.Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc.Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator.This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries.
  
With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.For information on the BCP Generator see: 
http://www.disaster-recovery-plan.comFor information on business continuity generally, see:

==================Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:
1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time.He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss!
2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!). This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system.Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings.To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost.
3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral. Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit.When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP.   CONTRIBUTIONS

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

QUESTIONS: From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com Subject: Using pictures as links I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures. How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. Mark moviebuff@cliffhanger.com ANSWERS:From: Zaak - Zaako@linkpaks.com Subject: Access using a proxy >From: CJ (cj5000@post.com) >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is blocking 50% of the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

SITES TO REVIEW:Site #124: http://www.BestWayToShop.com Dale Pike rhinopez@aol.com Site #125: http://www.wedeliverparties.com Dawn Clemons dclemons7@home.com Site #126: http://www.EClassifiedshq.com Carol Cohen Opp0rtunity@aol.com SITE REVIEWED:Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html Dennis damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as shown on the page.I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter. As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person doing the page is always good. We need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. ~~~~Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message. I did not like the background colour, however that is personal, it did not detract from the information. I was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*~~~~Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also are errors in the following paragraphs : ""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, send your to my email"" ~~~~A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 points size which gets difficult to read. ~~~~A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads. ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for YOUR favorite!

QUESTIONS: From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com Subject: Using pictures as links I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures. How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. Mark moviebuff@cliffhanger.com ANSWERS:From: Zaak - Zaako@linkpaks.com Subject: Access using a proxy >From: CJ (cj5000@post.com) >Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is blocking 50% of the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

(Issue #422) CJ, Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: http://www.anonymise.com and http://www.anonymizer.com . However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or may not visit, then it is time to change providers!

SITES TO REVIEW:Site #124: http://www.BestWayToShop.com Dale Pike rhinopez@aol.com Site #125: http://www.wedeliverparties.com Dawn Clemons dclemons7@home.com Site #126: http://www.EClassifiedshq.com Carol Cohen Opp0rtunity@aol.com SITE REVIEWED:Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html Dennis damorganjr@yahoo.com ~~~~I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as shown on the page.I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter. As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person doing the page is always good. We need some information about why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. ~~~~Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations for improving your page. 1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much. 2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional. 3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know they can unsubscribe. 4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to. 5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or an archive to see what information you have offered in the past. 6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that page. Remove all pricing information from the home page. ~~~~I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it! ~~~~This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the message. I did not like the background colour, however that is personal, it did not detract from the information. I was tempted to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*~~~~Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also are errors in the following paragraphs : ""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, send your to my email"" ~~~~A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be better served if he at least put some of the things out there for all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to subscribe. As it is, I would not bother. ~~~~What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 points size which gets difficult to read. ~~~~A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click for more info on your free ads. ________________________________________ VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting for YOUR favorite!

 ""Like everyone else, I had become a
slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
If I saw something like clever coffee
table sin the shape of a yin and yang,
I had to have it. I would flip through
catalogs and wonder, ""What kind of dining
set defines me as a person?"" We used to
read pornography. Now it was the Horchow

dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the honest,
simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of
wherever.""

6868,"Hey there,If you're like me, you've tried EVERYTHING to lose
weight.  I know how you feel - the special diets,
miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped
me lose a pound either.  It seemed like the harder I tried,
the bigger I got, until I heard about a product called
Extreme Power Plus.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister swore it helped her lose 23 pounds in just two weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a shot.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made. Period.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and got permission to resell it - at a BIG discount.  I want
to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I give you my personal pledge that Extreme Power Plus
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU.  If it doesn't, you can return it
any time for a full refund.    If you are frustrated with trying other products, not having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - EXTREME

 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of GermanyÂ’s political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, HitlerÂ’s personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the FÃ¼hrer. 
 
 Â“Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor,Â” said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. Â“Chancellor SchrÃ¶der is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,Â” said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Â“Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts,Â” replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of HitlerÂ’s book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 Â“The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,Â”
 the letter-writer said. Â“So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun.Â” Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaderÂ’s words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. Â“I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure,Â” the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 Â“Great that you want to join us!Â” enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, the Chancellor. 
 
 Â“I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism,Â” said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. Â“I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 Â“For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called Â— with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters,Â” Herr Popp said. 
 
 Â“I was stunned that political parties could react in this way Â— I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Â‘Adolf HitlerÂ’.Â”

Date: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be 
rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 
design a â€œnovelty formatâ€ to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 
look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 
required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 
number of parsers around the world. 
- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 
thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 
- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 
egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 
obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 
- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 
namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 
resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 
- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 
add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 
spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 
- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 
semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 
fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 
same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 
and inconsistent behavior across consumers. RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 
For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 
pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 
format, we have the worst one possible. Except, of course, for all the others. The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 
necessitiesâ€”RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 
has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 
weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 
possible in the first place. - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 
up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. 
- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 
content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 
valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 
mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 
introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 
display through unclosed HTML elements. 
- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 
matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 
where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 
and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 
in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 
flexibility. Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 
computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 
Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 
it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 
ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 
over the years to â€œdo RSS rightâ€â€”most notably RSS 1.0 in the 
year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 
fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 
- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 
the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 
later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 
parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 
parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 
is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 
Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 
recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 
actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 
of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 
feedâ€”in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 
worldâ€”by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 
into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 
- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 
haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 
flourishing. Evolvable formatsâ€”those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 
thousand small waysâ€”have three main characteristics that are germane to 
their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 
My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 
TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 
nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 
littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 
If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 
be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 
perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 
There is no middle ground. 
- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 
earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 
they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 
descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 
practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 
them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 
faces. 
- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 
Orgelâ€”â€œEvolution is cleverer than you areâ€. As with the list 
of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 
any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 
0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 
â€œdid things rightâ€. However, the ability to understand what is 
missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 
group can design a better system in the long haul. Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 
formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 
syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 
Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 
partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html

christian retor ( irisa , rennes ) edward stabler ( ucla , los angeles ) url : http : / / www . irisa . fr / rlmg e - mail : rlmg @ irisa . fr a workshop held as part of the 11th european summer school in logic , language and information ( esslli ` 99 ) , august 9-20 1999 , utrecht first call for papers esslli ` 99 : the main focus of the european summer schools in logic , language and information is the interface between linguistics , logic and computation . it is organized under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . foundational , introductory and advanced courses together with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of interest : logic , computation , language , logic and computation , computation and language , language and logic . previous summer schools have been highly successful , attracting around 500 students from europe and elsewhere . the school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . esslli-99 will take place at the university of utrecht , the netherlands , august 9-20 . in its second week it will feature a worskshop on resource logics and minimalist grammars . its aim is to provide a forum for advanced ph . d . students and other researchers to present and discuss their work on the connection between minimalist grammars and resource logics . workshop background : there has been a growing interest in connections between resource-logical theories of grammar and the minimalist grammars of the transformational tradition in syntax . a good understanding of these connections will reveal substantial differences that can be debated , and the prospects also look good for identifying a valuable common ground . in particular , the rich descriptive tradition of transformational theory may become more accessible to resource-logical frameworks , and the relatively well-understood mathematical foundations of resource-logical frameworks may stimulate a more sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms of minimalist grammars . linear logic is a neat and well studied logic from a proof theoretical perspective which is able to handle both logic for syntax ( like the lambek calculus ) and logic for semantics ( like intuitionistic logic ) , and it also appears to be a sensible framework for a logical treatment of minimalist grammars . this workshop aims to bring together phd students and other researchers in the respective traditions to explore these developments . topics of interest include but are not limited to : * applications of linear logic , multimodal categorial logic , and other resource logics to linguistic problems * formal and computational studies of minimalist and other generative grammars * studies of linguistic semantics from the perspective of either tradition * assessments of the common ground and differences among these approaches to language workshop aims : this workshop aims to : * provide a setting for researchers from various traditions to present and discuss recent work on resource logics and minimalist grammars * facilitate the exchange of ideas between researchers working in these respective areas * foster a spirit of collaborative research call for papers : researchers in the area , including phd students and young researchers , are invited to submit short papers ( between 8 and 12 pages long ) describing their thesis / research topic , approach and results . talks will be 20 minutes long , with 10 minutes for discussion / questions . authors are also encouraged to submit a list of topics they would like to see discussed at the workshop . this will help to identify issues for discussion and debate . deadline for submissions : march 15 , 1999 submissions should be sent to : rlmg @ irisa . fr submissions will be accepted in the form of either postscript or self-contained latex . authors of accepted papers will be notified by may 1st 1998 . the deadline for receipt of revised papers to appear in the workshop proceedings is june 1st 1998 . workshop format : the workshop will consist of five sessions of 90 minutes each held over five days . there will be either two or three presentations at each session with time for questions and discussion . it is hoped to have at least one invited paper from a senior researcher working in the field . publication : after the workshop , authors will have the opportunity to submit papers for possible publication in the new electronic journal "" language and computation "" ( http : / / www . dcs . kcl . ac . uk / journals / jlac / ) , which is supported by oxford university press . there will be more details in the next announcement . registration : workshop contributors will be required to register for esslli-99 . important dates : march 15th , 99 : deadline for

7567,"call for west - wide mitigation plan i have obtained a copy of a letter from representative tauzin and others to ferc chairman hebert which appears below . it could provide some indication of the direction ferc will take with the order it plans to issue next monday . summarizing , the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire wscc , which plan should : prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements ; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan adopt market mechanisms ( rather than imposing rigid price controls ) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs promote conservation and demand response please see details below . june 12 , 2001 the honorable curt h ? bert , jr . chairman federal energy regulatory commission 888 first street , ne washington dc , 20426 dear chairman h ? bert : since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west , including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into california . we recognize the commission ' s efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) . specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law . aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share the commission ' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply . accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution , the commission ' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission . to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity . such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices , "" foregone "" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume . specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale "" clearinghouse "" for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers , whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers . we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant consumers . we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission ' s previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request . sincerely , w . j .

How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things:How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP ServerThere are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.Until next week,

Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?

How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_ account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.

Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_PatchYou'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:

A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!

Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.Try this: go to:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&
and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.

A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdnsCheck out the original article over at:

Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:

15707,"query : latin and romance the following hypothetical question has arisen in connection with what is possibly a real case of the same sort , but in another domain . suppose that latin had only occasionally been written down , and suppose that all latin texts , and indeed all knowledge of latin , had been totally lost long ago , apart perhaps from the odd place name or personal name , now of unknown significance . suppose further that only a single romance language had survived down to the present day - - say , galician , or gascon , or sicilian - - and that this variety had been written down for no more than four centuries and had never acquired any learned words from latin . in fact , to be on the safe side , let 's assume that the entire indo - european family had died out apart from this one romance language . now , suppose that a few fairly substantial latin texts happened to be dug up somewhere , none of them longer than about fifty words , with word-boundaries not systematically marked and the subject matter unknown ; these might have been written down over several centuries , but in no case later than the first century bc . knowing the alphabet , we would be able to read them at the phonological level , at least roughly , but at first the language would be utterly mysterious . so here 's my question . would it be possible for specialists in that last surviving romance language to establish that the recovered texts in fact represented an archaic form of that language , and would they be able to use their knowledge to interpret ( at least in part ) the texts themselves ? if anything turns up , i ' ll summarize the responses and explain what the point of this admittedly curious inquiry is . i ' m sending this query to both the linguist list and the ie list ; my apologies to those who receive it twice . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",Safe Email

3085,""" english plus "" resolution in congress the "" english - plus "" resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ; ( 2 ) conserve and develop the nation 's linguistic resources by encouraging all residents of this country to learn or maintain skills in a language other than english ; ( 3 ) assist native americans , native alaskans , native hawaiians , and other peoples indigenous to the united states , in their efforts to prevent the extinction of their languages and cultures ; ( 4 ) continue to provide services in languages other than english as needed to facilitate access to essential functions of government , promote public health and safety , ensure due process , promote equal educational opportunity , and protect fundamental rights ; and ( 5 ) recognize the importance of multilingualism to vital american interests and individual rights , and oppose ` ` english - only ' ' measures and similar language restrictionist measures . house committee on economic and educational opportunities republicans democrats william f . goodling ( pa ) , chmn . william "" bill "" clay ( mo ) thomas e . petri ( wi ) george e . miller ( ca ) marge s . roukema ( nj ) dale e . kildee ( mi ) steven gunderson ( wi ) pat williams ( mt ) harris w . fawell ( il ) matthew g . martinez ( ca ) cass ballenger ( nc ) major r . owens ( ny ) bill barrett ( ne ) thomas g . sawyer ( oh ) randy cunningham ( ca ) donald m . payne ( nj ) peter hoekstra ( mi ) patsy t . mink ( hi ) howard mckeon ( ca ) robert e . andrews ( nj ) michael castle ( de ) john f .

1306,"comparative method these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser 's message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer 's statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer 's ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the "" true "" or "" real "" work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter 's recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer 's point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : "" since it is clear that everybody 's first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . "" ( please note the words "" first approximation "" in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : "" on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . "" ( please note the words "" the only way "" and "" establish "" . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) "" systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies "" may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the "" real work "" and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving "" nothing at all "" regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is "" real work "" . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally "" the real work "" . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser 's message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser 's mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser 's paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser 's message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg 's errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg 's method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg 's methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are "" obviously "" cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article "" common pathways of illumination "" by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) "" chance lookalikes "" certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of "" chance lookalikes "" to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of "" substrate "" and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg 's original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether "" limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . "" please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser 's assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as "" the "" ( read "" the only "" ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg 's data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the "" holy "" and the "" unclean "" , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser 's discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be "" necessary to exclude chance "" . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of "" the comparative method "" which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled "" typology of historical change "" . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard 's nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson",Safe Email

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim

The Philippines suffers from a Spanish-imposed aristocratic landowner
class, the same as in most of Latin America, with the serf-like
relationships that go with it.  You have multiple generations of
peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
human parts of the property package.The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,
but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption
even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number
of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad
years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that
makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases
have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops
several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow
land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come
back and give them something to do.The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to
the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the
process.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had
to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would
seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically
optimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they
use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive
economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for
free when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally
*prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;
they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,
and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of
all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal
agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their
land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who
will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming
scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only
real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the
economy.And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It
takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have
to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it
isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.Speaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On
Negros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)-James Rogers

11950,". . . . . use hypnosis to make money ! hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , "" i lost 15 pounds "" or "" i quit smoking . "" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying "" they "" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .",Phishing Email

"" "" i ' m running a linux box and use latex for all professional word - processing these days . . . i have n't found anything i can't do yet . "" "" i ' ll say this for linux , compared to dos , windows , os / 2 , desqview , and windows nt ( latest versions of all ) , i ' ve been running linux for a year and a half and it has never once crashed . never . every one of those others has . "" "" gee , i hope switching from a macintosh to a linux workstation is n't too painful . . . do you really have to do this ( power macintosh machines are indeed powerful , and the word processing situation is well developed with wordperfect 3 . 1 , nisus writer 4 . 06 , others ) . "" "" while on the topic of unix instantiations of tex , you might look at nextstep instead of linux . . . next 's gui is , honestly , elegant . "" "" there are several good ipa font sets for latex , as well as a whole bunch of accents available even if you do n't use special fonts . "" "" i use latex ( both on linux and on other unixes ) for all my papers and there are a couple good packages of phonetic symbol fonts that work great with latex . "" "" first of all , i dislike latex intensely , as do most of my colleagues in linguistics . we find it uniquely user-hostile : basically , you can't change any defaults unless you have a degree in hacking . . . on the whole , then , my advice is to stay away from latex . "" "" i am a linux user , and can assure you that latex and all sorts of extensions work very well with linux . so if you can find the linguistic tools for latex you should be able to use them with linux . "" i have also had a few requests that i share the information regarding where to find latex ipa fonts : there are apparently at least two , maybe more . one is called tsipa and is from japan . another is called wsuipa , and is from washington state university . one other person mentioned a font set from waterloo , but did not give more details . tsipa is available at ftp . shsu . edu in tex-archive / fonts / tsipa a couple people mentioned the tex - for-linguists newsgroup , at listserv @ shsu . edu , but this may no longer be running . there is also a tex newsgroup , comp . text . tex for more info . thanks again to all the people who responded so quickly . i am going to give the linux / latex system a shot , and see what i can make of it . - alex afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu alex francis ( 312 ) - 667-5432 department of linguistics afrancis @ midway . uchicago . edu university of chicago ( 312 ) 667-5432 ( home ) 1010 e . 59th st .

Robert Harley: >It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, >precisely identical between males and females.Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations. But that obscures the different modes of promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense of the word. But their motives and behavior are quite different.Langur monkeys were the example in the cited article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey .. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But cozying up to the current dominant male isn't the best strategy for female langurs, because ""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every 27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide,"" by the male who is likely next to rule the roost.Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a better picture of that. ;-)_________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com",Safe Email

no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.-- Seeya,
Paul

15888,"lincoln electric louise , i understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the lincoln electric sales agreement to oppd is not sufficient to justify paying $ 1 . 3 million to oppd in order for them to assume this contract . there are some considerations on this contract which i think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you : - the original sales contract to lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as "" toxic waste "" . - about a month ago , we agreed verbally with oppd to accept assignment of the sales contract , as oppd is one of the few parties which can serve it . - the execution of the documents has been delayed by lincoln , who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment - we have another , larger under - water transaction with oppd which we would like to move off the books at some point . we ' d like to keep oppd happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them ) - if we fail to deliver , we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $ 45 , 0000 per mw on top of liquidated damages ( lincoln is 15 mw for 02 and 30 mw for 03 ) . - this is a highly constrained area ( only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and oppd is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve lincoln ) : the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high . - there is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where enron fails to deliver . - even if we do wind up serving the contract , the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire . - trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve ( day - ahead notice on 20 % monthly load factor ) obviously , if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now , then we will smooth things as much as possible with oppd - but i wanted to make sure you had all the info . before we kill the deal . terri has stalled oppd until monday . dave",Safe Email

507,"they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies. And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect.

15039,"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 
http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<>
As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom

figuring out (surprise, surprise) that N-body problems with 10+ bodies

that the issue has been hashed over in sci.astro many, many times,
since even long before Hollywood posed the problem, and the very best
advice is still ""duck and cover""; if you are still going to nudge
anything, though, I'd nudge the rock (the one the size of a small
town) as you're less likely to re-define global agriculture that way.'Course, you're gonna have this problem of distributing the force over
a large enough surface area that it translates into a resillient
compression wave instead of a knifeblade/diamond faultline split.
It's also not a game of billiards, but a 6+ dimensional collision
problem (space, time, spin, temp, maybe electromag too if there's any
heavy metals in it, and there often is) complete with relativistic
effects and everything. Hands up all those with experience subjecting
blackboxed alien geology to sustained forces in excess of 100 megatons

Rhapsody rulesI never thought Iâ€™d say it, but Iâ€™m changing my tune about subscription music services.When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.comâ€™s Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now Iâ€™m rethinking my stance.Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, youâ€™ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you canâ€™t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.The e-mail address for your subscription isÂ

and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any
web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.  http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html--

physical value as well as the less physical value of lubricant (taxes,
bribes, payoffs, kickbacks)etc)--]And the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling
--]class -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al --They were put into the rulign cvlass by the mass consess that THEY are
amrt fellas who can make us feel good about giveing them the power to tell
us how to live our lives (and thus how to feel about ourselves,how to
value our worth, how to feel good about being etc etc etc)--]So, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or
--]investing in retirement plans?  I don't think so.  Are they stupid
--]for buying clothes and automobiles?  I don't think so.They are STUPID in allowing, heck forcing, the few to stand guard over the
many and then pay for the service of being servants to them.--]At the granular level, the notion that ""most rich people are rich
--]because they're smart"" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not
--]worth arguing about, so I won't.  Still, a compelling point worth
--]some clarification.
At the grainular level it is simply that Those who can con enough folks
into giving up thier Choices to a governing body (usualy one they will
control) wind up with the most concentration of Wealth (money) and
Power(over others)Basicaly we have gone back to being serfs, only we demand nicer hovels.
WE demand to have paid for a ruling class lord over us, protect us and
bascialy  build the castle walls stronger to protect us from all enemys of
the  status quo both forgien and domestic.If the constitution were allowed to go up for a vite of confiendnce todayI
bet it would fall down and go boom.. Too much freedom, too many ways that
the INdividual is called on to be thier own guardian...too many demands on
the fraility of human nature...much better to errect protectors, let them
sort it all out, and tell us what we need to do to be happy.
Smart in todays society is having enough Welath, Charm, Will, Power,
Knowing etc to Do What You Want.Stupid is living under others rules.
(to the stupid the smart are ""stupid"" ""look at them, wasting all thier
time  on that tomfollery"" ""lords a goshen, aint they the queer ones""
""would you  look at that, some folks just dont have the sense to fit in"")
The words Smart and Atupid are the wrong ones here... Lets change them toIndviduals  and Sheepleyea that works better for me.

14167,"6 . 136 language and species just a brief remark a propos of bemji wald 's comment on chomsky 's comment on whether apes can be shown to command ' reflexivization ' ; in particular the question of whether recognizing your image in a mirror as 's elf ' would be a sign of that ability . if it 's of interest , cats have a very peculiar relationship with mirrors . in my experience , most cats do not recognize images in mirrors , or tv , etc . as three-dimensional at all , and simply disregard them . but there are smart cats who do recogtnize their own images as cats in mirrors : but almost invariably as ' non-self ' . the typical reaction of a cat seeing itself in a mirror , if it 's a ' recognizer ' , is to bristle and hiss and go into defense-mode , or sometimes attack-mode . this of course raises what i like to call the dr doolittle problem : since we can't talk to animals we have to anthropomorphise and try to guess by analogy what they might be doing , but have no sense of what it feels like to be doing whatever . but in any case reflexivity is a bad example , because in general most animals do not have , in nature , any opportunity to see themselves ; animals that do confront mirror - like objects a lot ( say surface predators that hunt under water like herons , some cats , raccoons ) probably must deliberately as it were disregard the image they see , because they have to concentrate on refraction and what 's below the surface . roger lass department of linguistics university of cape town",Safe Email

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I 
start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things 
step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to 
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in 
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript 
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script 
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in 
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be 
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get 
up to speed.I'm off to the 
Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, 
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very 
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows 
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get 
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing 
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place 
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at 
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is 
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services 
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I 
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this 
evening just to be sure.With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via 
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. 
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't 
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A 
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some 
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking 
lots of photos, as usual.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeDOWNLOADS

http://www.thumpbunny.com/Seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes 
this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. The object is to 
clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two 
or greater at a time. Clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring 
awards clearing of larger clusters. Nothing gets killed, there's no 
swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway -- 
not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids.

Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE
http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application 
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, 
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this 
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost 
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your 
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is 
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection 
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.Â GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing 
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script 
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the 
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for 
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description 
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The 
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what 
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke 
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the 
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling 
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting 
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling 
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate 
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the 
bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell 
the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something 
could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" 
located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder,  The upcoming example 
will make this a bit more clear.Buy One Inkjet Cartridge - GET TWO FREE!!

down artistic opinion, straight from Glitschka's mouth on how to make a 
funny creation. This is by no means a Mac only site, the entertainment is 
accessible by everyone and icons are available in both Mac and PC versions.
Â GnomeTIPTraditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the 
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder 
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered 
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything 
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. 
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, 
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the 
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these 
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the 
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.Tip by Jake

Sep 16, 2002VIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers
discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club.The ï¿½130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and
baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies.But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk.Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only
came into service a few weeks ago.It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who
launched it in July.Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table.At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were
baffled by the problem.The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby.One Airbus worker said: ""We couldn't work it out. Then the penny
dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It
caused great amusement.""The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about ï¿½200.A Virgin spokeswoman said: ""Those determined to join the Mile High
Club will do so despite the lack of comforts.""We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something
that we would encourage because of air regulations.""The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan
""Mine is bigger than yours"". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far
East and the US.

' translation into the second language ' is firmly grounded in empirical research , and in this regard it serves as a stimulus and a methodological guide for further research . it will be a valuable addition for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of applied linguistics , translation theory , bilingualism and second language acquisition as well as those involved in teaching or practising translation at a professional level . stuart campbell associate professor in language studies , and director of the language acquisition research centre at the university of western sydney macarthur . further information on the books published in this series , and the table of contents for this title can be viewed at the longman linguistics on-line catalogue at : http : / / www . awl-he . com / linguistics for a complete listing of our world-wide offices , please click below : http : / / www . awl-he . com / offices available for review",Safe Email

6210,"silverman book review silverman , daniel . ( 1997 ) . phasing and recoverability . outstanding dissertations in linguistics series . new york : garland publishing . 242 pages . reviewed by stefan frisch , university of michigan . this book is a revised version of the author 's 1995 ucla dissertation . the primary thesis defended by silverman is that auditory salience plays an important role in explaining the typology of phonological segment inventories . the relative phasing of laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures is examined as a case study . silverman demonstrates there is a typological preference for phasing patterns in which the gestures are optimally recoverable . further , he proposes that sub-optimal patterns are only found in inventories where the optimal patterns are also present . ( note that silverman does not crucially adopt the segment as a phonological primitive . he is concerned primarily with gestures and their realization in a system of syntagmatic contrasts . the terms 's egment ' and 's egment inventory ' are used only for expository convenience . ) synopsis : chapter 1 . introduction this chapter introduces the primary thesis : cross - linguistically , laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are phased to make their values maximally auditorily salient . silverman argues that parallel production of contrastive gestures is informationally optimal , but only if those gestures are auditorily recoverable . in cases where parallel production would make contrastive values unrecoverable , gestures are serially sequenced . for example , in aspirated stops , laryngeal abduction is sequences to follow the stop closure , resulting in broadband noise . if laryngeal abduction and stop closure were simultaneous , the state of the larynx would not be recoverable from the resulting acoustic signal ( silence ) . silverman also introduces the ' gestural score ' notation of articulatory phonology ( browman & goldstein , 1986 ) used in the description of the gestural patterns . each gestural score is accompanied by a set of temporally aligned descriptions of acoustic cues which highlight the importance of the recoverability of the gestures . the resulting segmental percept is also given , to highlight whether all of the contrastive segmental information has been effectively transmitted . using this notation , he exemplifies the four logically possible phasing patterns : parallel , sequenced , expanded , or truncated . in the parallel phasing pattern , two gestures are phased to be fully simultaneous . in the sequenced pattern , two gestures are serially ordered . in the expanded pattern , one gesture both begins before and ends after another . in the truncated pattern , one gesture is phased to be simultaneous with a portion ( beginning or end ) of another gesture . chapter 2 . previous work in this chapter , silverman reviews previous research on articulatory timing , auditory response to acoustic signals , and the relevance of auditory contrastiveness to segmental inventories . two results are of particular importance . first , a combination of auditory factors favor patterns where low intensity signals are followed by high intensity signals . second , languages employ contrasts which are maximally auditorily distinct . chapter 3 . obstruents and laryngeal gestures this chapter contains typological evidence to support silverman 's thesis . cross - linguistically , laryngeal gestures of abduction or constriction are overwhelmingly phased to follow supralaryngeal constriction , which maximizes the recoverability of both gestures . the sub-optimal pattern , where the laryngeal gesture precedes the stop release is found only when the optimal pattern is also present . for obstruents , which have a minimum of acoustic energy to work with , these are the only two phasing patterns . chapter 4 . sonorants and laryngeal gestures sonorants have a greater amount of acoustic energy , and so laryngeal gestures can overlap with supralaryngeal gestures . the most attested pattern , for languages which do have a laryngeal contrast for sonorants , is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . parallel to the obstruent case , this phasing pattern puts the low-energy breathy or glottalized portion of the sonorant before the high-energy modally-voiced portion , maximizing auditory salience . again , the less optimal pattern truncates the laryngeal gesture to the latter portion of the supralaryngeal gesture . ordinarily , the laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures are not completely overlapped , as contrastive supralaryngeal gestures ( such as nasal place of articulation , for example ) would be rendered non - recoverable . however , an interesting special case is found in laterals . due to the formant structure of laterals , languages generally do not have contrasts in their place of articulation . thus , in some cases ( e . g . zulu ) , contrastive laryngeal gestures are realized fully parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture . a similar pattern is found for coda nasals in comaltapec chinantec , where the place of articulation is contextually determined . in contrast to onset nasals , which have contrastive place of articulation , laryngeal abduction is realized in parallel with the supralaryngeal gesture in coda nasals and no contrasts are lost . chapter 5 . vowels and laryngeal gestures in this chapter , vowels with contrastive laryngeal gestures are discussed . silverman claims that , since vowels have an abundance of acoustic energy , laryngeal gestures can be implemented in parallel with supralaryngeal gestures without loss of auditory contrast . however , this pattern is auditorily the least optimal . like the sonorant case , the optimal pattern is for the laryngeal gesture to be truncated to the beginning portion of the vowel , resulting in ? v or hv sequences . less optimal is the opposite phasing pattern , resulting in v ? or vh . typologically hv is indeed much more prevalent than voiceless vowels or vh ( and similarly for laryngeal constriction ) . the bulk of the chapter ( and the book ) is devoted to ' laryngeally complex ' vowels in the otomanguean languages . the term larygeally complex is used for vowels which realize both contrastive phonation ( breathy or creaky ) and tone . one example , comaltapec chinantec , has eight vowel qualities with five tonal qualities and two voice qualities . in addition , this language has nasalization and a length contrast which leads to 320 possible realizations of the nucleus . not surprisingly , words in this language are generally monosyllabic , and nucleus quality is used to differentiate many of the lexical contrasts . silverman argues that simultaneous realization of breathiness / creakiness and tone would render the tone contrasts unrecoverable . the cross-linguistically prevalent pattern is for the laryngeal contrast to be truncated to the beginning of the vowel , which is auditorily optimal . the tone is then saliently realized during modal phonation in the latter portion of the vowel . the opposite sequencing , with the laryngeal after the tonal contrast ( and modal phonation ) is also attested . silverman finds only two cases where tonal and laryngeal contrasts are executed simultaneously ( the tibeto - burman languages mpi and tamang ) . in one of those cases , there are only two tones , so tonal contrasts may not be in as much danger , as the tones would be more distinct than in the case of comaltapec chinantec , with eight tones . critical evaluation : overall , this is an inspirational volume demonstrating the importance of auditory / phonetic explanation for phonological patterning . it is one of the first of a series of ucla dissertations on this topic , which together address a wide range of phonological phenomena . silverman 's analysis bridges the phonetics / phonology gap in a number of ways . for example , an arbitrary number of phasing differences , which might be dismissed as ' phonetic implementation ' , are shown to be reducible to a small set that can be phonologically contrastive . this reduction , via the more abstract temporal relationships of simultaneity and precedence , nicely complements work in speech perception on the cross-linguistic ( and cross-species ) robustness of the categorical perception of voice onset time continua ( kuhl & miller , 1975 ; pisoni , 1977 ) . to its credit , this book contains over a dozen reasonably detailed case studies on the realization of laryngeal contrasts in different languages . in many cases , recordings were available so the presence of the phasing relationships were verified , and spectrograms of appropriate examples are given . these case studies often address potential counterexamples to silverman 's typological claims . for example , the mon - khmer language chong possesses coda stops with contrastive creakiness , but creakiness is realized only in the non-optimal way as a pre-glottalized stop . in the chong case , however , other aspects of the morphophonology require the non-optimal realization to avoid loss of contrast . in particular , coda stops are obligatorily unreleased , and the language is non-suffixing . due to these additional constraints , post-glottalized phasing would not saliently encode the larygneal contrast . this type of constraint interaction is quite compatible with the general approach of optimality theory ( prince & smolensky , 1993 ) , and in fact the original version of this dissertation presented constraint tableau in such cases . the proposed constraints are quite broad and were informally described , so the optimality theoretic analysis did not add to the exposition , and the book reads more easily without it . despite the lack of a formalist analysis , this book raises a number of issues which are relevant to current formal concerns . in the otomanguean language copala trique there are different phasing relationships between vocalic and laryngeal gestures . the laryngeal gestures ( breathiness and creakiness ) can be truncated to the first portion of the vowel , the second portion of the vowel , or can ' interrupt ' the vowel , appearing in the middle . these three locations for a laryngeal gesture support lexical contrasts , and there is clear evidence that the interrupted vowels are monosyllabic . encoding these three configurations using more abstract representations than articulatory phonology is no trivial task . in addition , the correspondence theory approach to faithfulness considers segmentally aligned and ordered input and output ( mccarthy & prince , 1995 ) . the presence of relatively small but contrastive differences in phasing require subsegmental correspondence relations between the input and output . another missing aspect of an optimality theoretic analysis would be a factorial typology of constraint interactions . while silverman 's coverage is quite extensive , i would be interested in seeing a discussion of the pros and cons for each logical possibility in phasing between laryngeal and supralaryngeal gestures . such a discussion will eventually be needed in order to determine whether the silverman 's proposal is is truly predictive , or just informally defined to the extent that any observed pattern could be explained . in a few instances , silverman makes use of the upsid database of segmental inventories ( maddieson , 1986 ) to demonstrate that the typological predictions are satisfied . unfortunately , quantitative differences are not reported in most cases . while sufficient data may not be available , a quantitative analysis is desirable in order to address a current question in work on phonetic explanation for phonological patterns : are non-optimal patterns avoided to the degree that they are non-optimal ? in other words , is the hypothesized functional force of auditory recoverability transparently reflected in the patterns within and across languages , or is it ' phonologized ' in some way by the language learner such that there is no quantitative relationship ? the answer to this question has implications for the architecture of the phonetically grounded grammar , as quantitative constraints or quantitative constraint rankings would be required . this book touches on a number of other very important issues that should be topics of ongoing research . the central role of the recoverability of contrasts leads inevitably to the question : what is a contrast ? assuming the psychological reality of the segment provides a simple answer , but one which is not entirely correct . the three contrastive phasing relationships in copala trique are not amenable to a segmental analysis . in chong , a combination of coda unrelease and lack of suffixation is claimed to lead to pre-glottalized stops . this case is contrasted with korean , where there is some suffixation , and post-glottalized stops are maintained in that environment but neutralized elsewhere . i wonder how frequent the neutralizing environment must be before a non-optimal pattern becomes necessary or the contrast is lost ? why is n't the laryngeal gesture phased before the stop closure in the neutralizing environment , but after in the non-neutralizing environment ? perhaps some other constraint is involved here . in many of the case studies given , the simple syllable structure and monosyllabic tendencies of the languages are mentioned as reasons why complex and non-optimal phasing relations are found at all ( in most cases , the optimal recoverability of supralaryngeal gestures is found if contrastive laryngeal gestures are not used at all ) . this suggests that there is some minimal set of contrasts required to create a sufficient number of open class items for a language to be a useful communication system , and that differences in syllable structure , word length , and segmental inventory size interact in some fashion to this end . the answers to these deeper questions appear to be closer to our understanding when the phonological system is conceptualized as implied in this book , as a combinatorial system of articulatory / acoustic contrasts highly constrained by a variety of functional factors . references :

15010,"kant and innateness references to innateness in kant are not easy to find , but here is one that is relevant to the current controversy regarding linguistic "" realism "" vs . "" conceptualism . "" a middle course may be proposed bewtween the two above mentioned , namely , that the categories are neither self-thought first principles apriori of our knowledege nor derived from experience , but sujective dispositions of thought , implanted in us from the first momement , so ordered by our creator that their employment is in complete harmony with the laws of nature in accordance with which experience proceeds - - a kind of preformation-system of pure reason . . . there is this decisive ojection . . . that the necessity of the categories . . . then would have to be sacrificed . ( b167-168 . _ critique of pure reason _ trans . kemp smith . ) noam chomsky observes that "" rationalist "" as well as "" empiricist "" theories of language incorporate "" innate dispositions . "" ( _ reflections on language _ . pantheon . 1975 . p . 215 ) whether the logical modalities enter the linguistic picture is uncertain , but one can imagine that on some formulation of minimality the connection with economy of derivation may be necessary in some sense , to choose a possible example just for the purpose of illustration . if so , then such modalities may not exclude "" psychologism "" in linguistics and with it conceptualism ala chomsky . one consequence would be that arguments against extending linguistic "" psychologism "" to logic would not be barred for the fregean reasons sometimes cited by linguists ( e . g . katz and postal in _ linguistics and philosophy _ . 14 , 1991 . p . 520 . the importance of kant for the history of the philosophy of linguistics is not innateness , rather it is in recognizing that concepts are rules . ( ibid . a106 ) . these rules allow the identification of the forms of "" judgments .

14493,"Hello,Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?Thanks,--

( e . g . a 20 m / d package might involve a day bidding process , a 100 m / d block may involve a week posting ) . demonstrate that puts / calls don ' t undercut the release market . explain that release is used for day to day decisions , while we believe options will serve to help shippers with longer term strategic decision . be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations . work on the definition of the 4 options types . they stumbled over some of the wording , like the use of phrase "" recall "" in the transporter call . detailed notes we had a surprisingly positive reception from rates west . this could be due in part to mike coleman ' s reputed continued interest on the electric side and his self - proclaimed corporate bent . he did say that he understands the underlying business drivers for this program and suggested that a flushed out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts . he said that the timing on this type of offering is good now , as the chairman is pressuring staff to improve the marketplace ( the california situation again ) . both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in the filing , including examples of each type of options . as mike delineated and we expected , the major issues that may cause discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding ( cornering the market under a long - term option ) or speculative capacity holding . to defend the service , we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an improvement over our present situation ( discounted firm ) . some specific questions from the rates group included : how does this impact capacity release how does tw protect against hoarding why aren ' t all options considered negotiated rates . are options tradable alone ( without capacity ) would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ena how are rofrs affected some specific questions from the policy group included : what are discriminating parameters / business decisions in allocating capacity how are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity how are options posted , bid on ? what are parameters of the options , specify range is it in the contract is this a physical or financial product does this verge into negotiated t & c territory ? is this like koch ' s option proposal ?

3808,"sum : linguistics and imperialism some two weaks ago i posted a question on whether linguistics has it 's origin in imperialistic effords . i pointed to cases like arabic grammar , latin and sanskrit . ( the sanskrit case quite obviously did not fit ) o . k . , i put it in a provokative fashion , formulated more sharply than i really had it in mind . the reactions were vivid . the case of india ( sanskrit ) : it was pointed out that in the sanskrit case the concern was to preserve the "" correct "" language which was in danger of beeing lost otherwise which would have made religious texts unreadable . ( michael newman , karl v . teeter , mechthild reh , european cases : generally , the intention was more the emancipation from latin and / or to give the own country a status as respectable as the roman empire . ( michael newman , mechthild reh ) spanish : the first grammar was published 1492 , before the the concest of america , at the time of the fall of the kingdom of granada . ( michael newman ) nynorsk : the rise and conception of nynorsk ( landsmaal ) in norway in the 1800s was part of the nationalist reaction to danish rule ( imperialism ) . that 's a long story , but nynorsk never succeeded in dominating norway , i ' m afraid . ( jon hareide aarbakke ) linguistics as an emancipatory efford : ( mechthild reh , see gupta below , ) the term "" imperialistic "" : > i think it is inappropriate to use terms like > "" imperialist "" that only make sense once the conquest and > subjugation of > other peoples came to be seen as perhaps somewhat unethical . no > one at the times you were speaking of would have done that , so > the term is anachronistic . ( michael newman ) are linguists imperialists ? several people asked wheather i was thinking in that direction . i certainly do n't ! ! linguistics can help to answer lots of questions ( see the greek sophistic tradition ) . the question was more to what made any linguistic attempt suddenly beeing successful on a national level . thus , my idea refers more to linguistics beeing ( mis ) used than beeing evil . ( actually , i ' m a linguist as well ) . general aggreement : > grammar books in english came into being in the > 18th century , together with the early dictionaries , and > most people say that this is to do with the insecurity > of middle-class english speakers faced with a language > that was being latinised . and interestingly , the > british ventures to india and north america i think > also coincided with the period .

keiko tanaka ; reiko itani ; kunihiko imai ; nam sun song ; akiko yoshimura ; tomoko matsui ; seiji uchida ; robyn carston ; ken - ichi seto ; hideki hamamoto ; masa - aki yamanashi ; dan sperber & deirdre wilson . political discourse in transition in europe ( 1989-1991 ) edited by : paul a . chilton , mikhail v . ilyin and jacob l . mey university of warwick / moscow institute of international relations / odense university 1998 x , 272 pp . pragmatics & beyond new series , 36 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 329 7 price : us $ 69 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 5048 0 price : nlg 138 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com the year 1989 brought political upheavals in central , eastern and southern europe , the effects of which have not yet ended . the political discourse of the cold war period disintegrated and gave way to competing alternatives . the contributors to this book are linguists , discourse analysts and social scientists , from all corners of the continent , whose tools of analysis shed light on the crucial two years of transition during which political concepts and political interaction changed in dramatic and sometimes violent ways . contributions by : mikhail v . ilyin ;

with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
the whole area.--

New Page 1Hi,            Want to increase your chances of winning a big jackpot in those
            Internet contests?            Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about
            in USA Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes
            it hundreds of times easier to win online.            He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in
            online contests--over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop).
            We at Grab.com are so excited by this system that we're putting it
            online for our members to use.
            THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!            If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours
            to keep--GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael's program
            is legal, and online contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn't
            violate their rules. So if you win a prize, you'll receive it.
            If you don't receive it, we'll pay you ourselves. GUARANTEED.
            FREE TO USE.            Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for is related
            network expenses--which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service.
            That's dozens of entries for what you'd usually pay to get a single
            lottery ticket!            As a member in good standing of this mailing, we've already
            set up the automatic entry system for you. All that's left
            is for you to turn it on. Once you do, you can sit back and watch it
            enter you into contest after contest after contest after contest....
Click
            here to begin!            P.S. This system will continue to enter you into hundreds of free
            contests until you win (or cancel it).            P.P.S. All the prizes you win are yours to keep--GUARANTEED!(C)

I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept

14593,"re : sapir - whorf and what to tell students these days here 's what i tell my undergrad and grad students about that same chapter in language files . i . e . , it 's difficult to even judge what 's going on with whorf unless you are simultaneously conversant with linguistics , american indian languages , and at least the insights of modern physics . first , the conclusion that is appropriate is that , as i showed in "" the demise of the whorf hypothesis "" ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , what whorf said has little or generally no relation whatever to the entire body of discussion that comes under the name "" ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis "" . he showed decades before the critics came up with their own hypotheses , which they failed to name after themselves , that he would never have agreed with their characterization of his thoughts . simple test : read the lf chapter and then ask , "" who created the whorf hypothesis ? "" and a quick way to answer this is : what did whorf himself call it in his two or three references ? he called it the "" principle of linguistic relativity "" or the "" linguistic relativity principle "" . my own reading of whorf never finds the word "" hypothesis "" at all . so - - right off the bat , and this is a good way to teach scientific nomenclature , who turned whorf 's ' principle ' into a ( n ) ' hypothesis ' , and why ? it was n't whorf , because his designation was clear . so what is the difference between the two ? well , a principle is like an axiom in geometry : a starting point which is theoretically unverifiable - - it 's just a starting point . you want something else , you begin from a different starting point , and then you develop your hypotheses from there . next : what does whorf 's "" linguistic relativity principle "" have to do , if anything , with einstein 's "" relativity principle "" ( which i covered in my also bls , 1980 ? , paper , "" is whorf 's relativity einstein 's relativity ? "" ) . ah , now we ' ve gotten to the crux of it - - much against pinker 's stand ( which was copied and intensified in a lingua franca short bio of suzette elgin hayden recently , where a digression found its author saying that whorf cobbled together his theory from a few ill-translated snatches of apache - - echoing a pinker statement and relying on pinker 's quoting whorf correctly , which he did n't , about a canoe on a beach pointwise : which pinker identified as an apache sentence , but which whorf knew quite well was nootka in the pacific northwest rather than apache in the beachless desert ) , whorf was upping the ante on einstein , who argued that euclidian geometry , far from being universal , was applicable only to flat surfaces ; that for round surfaces , which most of reality is made up of , you need non - euclidian geometry . i . e . , when the phenomena change significantly , you have to change the tool you ' re using . well , that 's what whorf said too ( see heisenberg 's lament below ) , except he moved its domain from mathematics to natural human language ; hence : the truly aptly named "" principle of linguistic relativity "" as whorf himself named it . admittedly , this does n't make any sense until you see it in action , in "" an american indian model of the universe , "" where he posits a worldview without our tense / time ( past / present / future diorama or river of time ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus other synonyms ) instead . that is : sae grammars / cultures give that aforementioned notion of "" time "" , which is supported and maintained by their tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird and gets it through the culture side of the language / culture system ) ; the hopi language / culture system has no such image of time , working from a different worldview principle that sees only cyclical , not linear , time - - round , not flat . most of the world 's grammars that have broken out of the latinate mold show that the particular time / tense system of sae is pretty much peculiar to western european languages - - hence a linguistic / cultural ontology of "" time "" as we know and practice it , and not the supposed universal we have so fondly believed it to be . side note : for one who reads whorf closely , he makes five or ten times more universalist statements than relativity statements in his writings , yet he is seen ( and reviled in a chomskyan universalist attitude ) as the relativist par excellent . so right from the get-go we see that 1 ) whorf did n't write and would n't agree with the hypothesis that someone ( s ) named after him ; 2 ) rather than being some deranged crackpot , he was merely literate : whorf was one of the few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics and linguistics in this century ; 3 ) whorf 's relativity principle had something important to do with einstein 's ; and 4 ) whorf was a universalist as well as a relativist - - he just had them in balance , a notable enough rarity in current academe , you must admit . if i may be so bold , alluding to your posting that "" no one has disproved whorf 's mild version of linguistic relativity ( let 's leave ling . determinism aside , or the stronger version . ) "" , even the mild version was n't his ! trace back like i did and you will find that whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions of determinism , and relativity has nothing to do with determinism when you see it from the physics viewpoint above , as he did . if you read carefully , writers about the whorf hypothesis admit that even whorf did n't hold a strong version of determinism ( so if he did n't , who did ? and if nobody did , why bring it up ? ) , and that all the critics hold the weak version that they dreamed up ( even though whorf would n't hold it because it 's at least weakly deterministic and therefore newtonian ) . so what 's going on ? the problem is that whorf had already , from his acquaintance with physics , moved from newtonian monocausal determinism as an ideal into systems thinking - - where sometimes the opposite of one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . the cumulative effect of the ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily to throw up a smokescreen around his ideas so that people , including grad students in linguistics , psychology , anthropology and sociology , won't read him in the original ( english ! ) . i tell my grad students that if they want to really find out what their discipline is about , go find out who their discipline is beating up on and read them ; and if you are so lucky as me to find someone that four major academic disciplines are ganging up on - - you know you ' ve hit a goldmine ! what in the world could be so important that four academic disciplines create a combined smokescreen ? because so few linguists in this century have availed themselves of the changes in thinking about reality that physics has been broadcasting during this entire century , few linguists are even qualified to step into what they did n't realize was an interdisciplinary debate in the history of ideas which whorf felt so comfortable in . i ' ll explain . i ' ll give you a synopsis of a talk i intend to give at a 100th birthday conference for benjamin whorf , which i intend to get funding for and hold in the bay area in spring 1997 . i call it "" heisenberg 's lament . "" you see , early in this century , that ' uncertain ' heisenberg was among the first to gain a ' glimpse ' into the subatomic world ; and , having done so , he rendered his opinion that , regarding the subatomic realm , "" we have reached the limits of our language . "" he said this for two reasons : 1 ) no matter how glibly western scientists talk about electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , when we look into that realm there are no ' things ' , only processes and relationships ; but in order to make sense ( i . e . , complete sentences ) in sae languages , we need nouns - - and there 's nothing in the subatomic realm that you can , except willy-nilly , attach nouns to . and 2 ) given that , our most fundamental scientific terms such as "" same "" and "" different "" are useless . he did n't know then , and physics does n't know now , whether there are gazillions of electrons or just one electron with gazillions of manifestations . we have reached the limits of our language . fast - forward a few decades and whorf hears this in his physics classes at yale ( he has unpublished manuscripts on gravity in the yale archives ) , and ponders : hm , i wonder if this has anything to do with what prof . sapir said the other day about hopi not needing nouns to express ordinary propositions - - just "" rehpi "" , "" flashed "" , instead of "" it "" or "" the / a light flashed "" : because when you come right down to it , how is the flashing different from the light ? is "" light "" just a convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us by sae grammar ? and as he pondered ' light ' being noun or verb , particle or wave , depending on how it 's viewed , he saw the universe in the same way , with different cultures taking different positions on the question . in this case , since hopi did n't seem to take too seriously the absence of nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi could be of use for physicists in exploring and reporting back about the quantum world , that realm that did n't have thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades and physicist david bohm reads whorf ( which i confirmed personally in talking to him ) , and then , * in response * ( my attribution ) , writes _ wholeness and the implicate order _ , in which he , among other things , tries to make english more verby and performative in the "" rheomode "" - - a brilliant flop ; and then launches on the scientific community a view of the universe which does not contain our familiar notions of past / present / future time , but instead an implicate and explicate order of reality - - an "" inny / outty "" notion where the future is inside us working outward instead of some vague distant goal we are headed toward . an email acquaintance pointedly asked me what the difference was between bohm 's terminology and whorf 's terminology ; it took me 6 months to finally answer that there was none , except the hopis had had theirs for millennia longer . and then it hit me ! bohm , in his own maverick way , appropriated whorf 's answer to heisenberg 's lament in "" an american indian model of the universe "" and substituted more scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather than manifesting / manifested ) to see how the notion of a universe without linear time would fly in the modern physics and academic community - - and it had qualified success . but - - bohm was no closer to knowing whether whorf had been accurate in his description of hopi than he had been before writing the book . and there had been so much bad press on the guy ! how was one to know , ultimately ? and here 's the part that almost no-one knows so far . in 1991 , in the last few months of his life , david bohm launched his most ambitious thought experiment to date : with some other physicists and a few psychologists and linguists , and sponsored by the fetzer institute , he enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( and some of their elders ) to join in dialogue together in what i can only describe as a roundabout way of asking american indians whether whorf was accurate in his description of the ' timeless ' hopi worldview . but it became so much more ! the american indian leaders there had previously read bohm 's book and others , but the physicists knew nothing about native american worldviews and native american science methodologies , so the indians had to build a bridge over to them in private meetings before the three public days on the themes of time , space and language . during the day on time , whorf 's description of hopi came up , was read out loud , and discussed , though i do n't remember any hopis being present ; nevertheless , the other american indians present , mostly of algonquian tribes , gave what can only be called ' independent verification ' in scientific terminology by saying essentially : well , i can't speak for the hopi people , but that 's pretty much the way we do it . in fact , of the many whorf passages read or discussed in these dialogues , the physicists and the american indians present were usually willing to give whorf his points ( proving again , perhaps , the difficulty of being a prophet in one 's own country / discipline ! ) . but we ' re not done yet - - the best is yet to come - - the actual conclusion of heisenberg 's lament ! at the beginning of the first dialogue it was clear that the quantum physicists had their favorite realm to explore and talk about , and the american indians also had their own favorite realm . as we dialogued , it began becoming clear that those favorite realms had some fundamental principles in common : the only constant is flux ; everything that exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected such that the part implicates the whole . in fact , it became crystal clear that the last major obstacle to these realms being the same realm was really only terminological : the physicists are used to calling it "" the subatomic realm "" whereas the american indians for millennia have been calling it "" the spirit realm "" . now that 's a big enough surprise - - that modern physics is knocking on the door of spirit without really meaning to - - but not big enough , so now let 's take it home ! it puzzled the physicists just how the american indians should have foreknowledge of a realm they should n't know about , that the western scientific infrastructure had just recently led us to - - and the indians had no such scientific infrastructure ! and as the physicists gradually understood that , like hopi , the algonquian grammatical structures do not demand nouns , do not demand fictitious actors to embody actions ( that , as my mikmaq and blackfoot friends tell me , they can talk all day long in those languages and never utter a single ' noun ' ! ) , they finally had to admit that such languages were indeed much better suited to exploring that realm and reporting back than sae languages - - whorf 's reply to heisenberg 's lament was verified and agreed upon . when the phenomena of reality change in a dramatic way , you need to change the tool you ' re using . now , of course , the physicists were left with an even larger puzzle , to wit : how is it that these american indians have a language much better suited than sae languages to investigate and describe the inner workings of the subatomic realm - - a realm they are n't even supposed to know about ! ? ! as you can see by now , pinker - - like all other facile critics and unindicted co-creators of the so-called hypothesis - - is out of his league altogether in attempting to characterize a major player in one of the most important interdisciplinary discussions ever in the history of ideas . pinker , like chomsky , loves logic ( which grows out of the grammar of sae languages just as the philosophy of ' karma ' grew out of the grammar of ancient sanskrit , where it was used earliest as the linguistics term for 'd irect object ' ! ! ) , but has never really gotten with the program this century to replace binary / dualistic thinking with multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard the call , way back then , and may yet prove to have been an entire century ahead of his time in linguistics . even though we can think in systems for phonology and grammar , we have a tough time doing it for "" language and thought "" ; we feel we have to make them bipolar opposites such that they are distinct and one causes the other invariantly ; that 's why i so admired how slobin finally lost those monolithic terms and framed the question instead in terms of "" thinking for speaking "" - - the at least one kind of thinking where your thinking is very much at the mercy of the forms and categories of your language , per whorf . so tell your students , as i do , that the only way to get to the bottom of what whorf did or did not say is to read his essays in _ language , thought & reality _ for themselves , perhaps with the above thoughts as a guideline , and then figure out for themselves whether the sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes any sense .",Safe Email

how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop will be organized as a series of panels reporting on the outcome of discussions in the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the coling - acl workshop ) . ample time for discussion will be included . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . o speech recognition and synthesis o language and speaker identification and speech translation program committee khalid choukri , european languages resource association charles fillmore , university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid , university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy , information sciences institute , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa mun kew leong , national university of singapore joseph mariani , limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury , the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg , new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura , nec , japan martha palmer , university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky , brandeis university , usa peter schaueble , eth zurich , switzerland oliviero stock , irst , italy felisa verdejo , uned , spain piek vossen , university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster , dfki , germany antonio zampolli , istituto di linguistica computazionale , italy organizers bob frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6656 fax : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : ( + 1 310 ) 822-1511 fax : ( + 1 310 ) 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa tel : ( + 1 914 ) 437 5988 fax : ( + 1 914 ) 437 7498 e - mail : ide @ cs . vassar . edu",Safe Email

"" as a result of this purchase , northern natural gas cannot take certain actions , including seeking bankruptcy court protection , without the consent of dynegy as a preferred stockholder , "" dynegy said in a statement . dynegy also said despite canceling its proposed purchase of enron , it still has the right to buy all the common stock of northern natural gas and intends to close that transaction on dec 12 . upon closing , about $ 950 million of northern natural gas debt will remain , it said . enron , which is widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection , contests dynegy ' s claim . "" dynegy ' s right to exercise the option is not dependent on enron ' s agreement to our right to terminate the merger , "" dynegy said . northern natural gas was formerly part of internorth , which merged with houston natural gas in the mid - 1980 s to form enron , and has been a separate unit for more than 20 years , dynegy said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . uk : update 1 - enron says 1 , 875 mw uk teesside station operating . 11 / 30 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , nov 30 ( reuters ) - the 1 , 875 megawatt teesside gas - fired power station operated by enron was delivering electricity to the national grid as normal , the company said on friday .

"" if there were circumstances where there would not be enough marginal spare capacity we would ask generators to increase output , "" a spokesman for the national grid told reuters . "" it is standard practice , "" he said . the troubled u . s . energy group , which boasted revenue of $ 101 billion in 2002 , is on the verge of bankruptcy after surprising off - balance sheet disclosures triggered a share price collapse . the teesside combined cycle gas - fired power station , which came on stream in 1992 , is 50 percent owned by enron with the other 50 percent split between midlands electricity , northern electric , owned by midamerican energy , the u . s . utility controlled by warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway and western power distribution . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . uk : update 1 - innogy may buy enron uk assets at "" right price "" . 11 / 30 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , nov 30 ( reuters ) - british utility innogy said on friday it would consider buying enron ' s generation and retail assets in britain if the price were right .

"" as with every company , we will look closely but it is too early and nothing has been offered yet , "" he said . analysts said teesside , which came on stream in 1992 , could be an attractive buy as it has constant income . "" teesside has a fairly steady revenue stream thanks to its power purchase agreement , but that is likely to run out in about 2008 so the station ' s prospects after then will be less attractive , "" an analyst who declined to be named said . enron direct has about 150 , 000 customers in the small to medium - sized business sector in britain , a market which analysts say shows good revenues and strong margins . "" enron direct is likely to be snapped up , "" said david kurtz , an analyst at datamonitor , who thought another potential buyer aside from innogy ' s retail arm npower would be powergen . enron ' s european trading operations were placed into adminstration on thursday as its u . s . parent tottered on the brink of collapse , but the teesside plant and enron direct were excluded . "" it was the trading operations which were placed into administration because they depended on funds from houston ( enron ' s u . s . headquarters ) . but teesside and enron direct , and several other business have their own revenue streams , "" an enron spokesman said . analysts expect all enron ' s european assets , which include power stations in turkey , italy and poland will be sold . other european business outside adminstration include enron credit , enron metals , enron wind , and wessex water . enron credit , the unit which specialised in selling credit insurance to corporates , faces being wound - up with most of the 35 - strong staff leaving the company on friday while britain ' s united utilities has already expressed an interest in acquiring wessex water .

GET WINDOWS XP TIPS: Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. 
GET YOUR COPY 
of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!    This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
XPlay remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
SIC without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
winferno.com, although I'm sure 
we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
free copy of Research-Desk 
for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
the eSellerate gang, with a 
discussion about GnomeTomes and 
what the future holds.Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
Crosspaths.net connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

Click for DetailsWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (NR) 1966
Adapted Play - 131min
Reviewer's Tilt (10)
 Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

no    19%Comments:
~~~~~~~~~No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

No. This is a funny thing to me.Â  I hear about so many
people being super scared to give out their SS#.Â  Well folks,
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.Â  Give me a name and address
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.Â  They could do
who knows what with the CC number.Â  I once had a person
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
person (me) would have her account info and could write
a check out for thousands of dollars.Â  I told her to just send
it to me then and she said that was OK.Â  Then I asked her
to tell me what the difference was between the original check
and a fax copy.Â  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.Â 
Never
heard back from her.
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
available in many places.Â  Have a good day.

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
importantly, never give any personal information at a site
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
or a Veri secure sign or others.
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
in my credit information in each time instead of having
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--Â  Catherine F.Â Â Â Â Â  http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
was in a bad car accident.Â  I had a full service account.
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
went unprotected.Â  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
address to a porn shop.Â  Thus, I lost 4 years of building
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
on 8 more.Â  This set me back about 4Â  months: I believe I
lost a minimum of $50,000.
Â 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.Â  The first
time I lost almost 4 months of work.Â  Now, I back up often
enough to not to lose so much time.Â  This is also Internet
theft.Â  These people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars.
Â 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.Â  I sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com

marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.

2604,"financial and marketing skills seminar we are not affiliated with any university or college . we are a private business consulting company . the seminar ' s topics are linked together by two overarching business methodologies : i . value - based financial management methodology a . to provide a return on investment ( roi ) to stockholders , management has to continually increase the value of the business , through producing significant profitable annual sales growth , which generates a sufficient level of free cash flow . although , profitability is the necessary condition of a business or a new product , it is not sufficient , because , contrary to conventional business wisdom , profits are not cash . the necessary and sufficient condition of a successful business or a new product is free cash flow , which is the real measure of generated economic value . b . in addition , the free cash flow has to be at a sufficient minimum level to cover the weighted average cost of capital , the risk adjusted cost of capital or the opportunity cost of capital . in other words , before a company can generate a satisfactory level of free cash flow to increase the value of the business , the company has to invest capital and achieve a roi greater than the cost of the capital itself . hence , looking upon a business as a collection of investment projects , for example , investments in new or existing products , new manufacturing equipment , sales programs , information technology software and systems , etc . , the goal has to be to have every investment project generate or save a significant level of free cash flow , and thereby , achieve a sufficient roi . accordingly , every investment project can , and has to be measured on a free cash flow basis . c . to accomplish the above , companies have to measure the correct financial value drivers , with the correct tools . in addition , the companies have to use the same tools to measure all the various types of investment projects , as well as , measuring the business as a whole , and utilize the identical tools employed by professional investors , to assist them in making their investment decisions vis - - vis the company . consequently , companies cannot use standard accounting methods to measure roi , like return on equity ( roe ) or return on assets ( roa ) , which measure substandard value producing activities . additionally , roe and roa cannot be used to measure all the various types of investment projects , and professional investors cannot use them to make successful equity and / or debt investment decisions . ii . value - based product marketing and development methodology a . optimize products and prices between buyers , competitors , and internal financial requirements , using an externally driven development process , that is , 1 ) identify the buyers ' problems , needs , and / or the benefits required by the buyers ; 2 ) determine the value to be delivered to the buyers , with emphasis on incremental value delivered via competitive advantages ; 3 ) set prices based on the value delivered , pricing segments analysis , pricing leverage analysis , pricing strategy and / or the marketing strategy ; and 4 ) determine the product development investment and manufacturing costs that can be justified . b . identify the business value creating market segments , and the product line development sequencing , through the development of a strategic product marketing plan , that identifies the market segments , price segments , optimum prices , product configurations , product development investments , manufacturing costs , targeted marketing and sales programs , and unique product positionings . c . identify the value delivered to the buyers through price segments identification , pricing leverage analysis , competitive value analysis , and classifying features and benefits based on the value they deliver to the buyers , that is , required , persuasive , and preemptive features and benefits , and detrimental , dissuasive , and preemptively dissuasive features . amongst , the specific topics presented are : 1 ) how to identify the value producing market segments for a product , 2 ) how to quickly evaluate new product or business opportunities , before performing a detailed evaluation , and 3 ) why you should , and how to calculate the free cash flow , and the return on investment ( roi ) generated from a new or existing product investment , a marketing or sales program , an information technology system or a manufacturing automation investment . on our web site , we list the major product and financial questions answered in the seminar . these questions are especially informative in respect to the overall content presented in the program . if you or your associates can answer these questions today , don ' t attend the seminar . however , if you or they cannot answer these questions , please register for one of our sessions . this seminar has been extremely well received by over 10 , 000 professionals from large , and small companies . as affirmation , see the letters from sharp electronics , manugistics , advanced micro devices , verizon , sony , ibm , varian associates , mdl information systems , and rise technology . in addition , to marketing and financial professionals , the seminar attracts sales , scientific , manufacturing , and engineering managers , who want to deepen their understanding of the subjects covered . it helps them to design and manufacture value - producing products , and to communicate more effectively with their counterparts in the marketing and financial functions . the seminar provides the participants with real business skills that can be applied to their everyday work tasks . one of the major skills being the ability to think concretely about roi , and to actually calculate it for all types of investments , for example , new or existing products , new manufacturing equipment , sales programs , information technology software and systems , etc . in addition , although , the participants will learn how to evaluate the balance sheet , income and cash flow statements , the financial focus is not on debits and credits or accounting mechanics . the emphasis is on understanding financial objectives and analysis techniques . if you want to improve your or your peoples ability to think as product marketing savvy and financially adroit business people , then please register yourself or them for one of our seminars . we would also be happy to discuss an in - house seminar , either standard or customized , with the associated reduced fee per attendee versus the above fee for our public seminars . we also conduct an all financial version of this seminar called the financial mba seminar . however , we only conduct this seminar as an in - house session . additionally , send us an e - mail , if you would like us to e - mail you an adobe acrobat pdf file containing all the information on our web site . intelligent resources 106 pasatiempo drive santa cruz , ca 95060 this e - mail message is an advertisement and / or solicitation .",Phishing Email

"" as seen on national t . v . ! ! thank you for your time and interest . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved , once and for all , that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home . the results of this show has been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing , much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it .

"" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to "" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to "" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps "" a "" through "" f "" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free !

   CARTOON EDITOR
   Version: 1.2.1
   File size: 2.38MB
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X   Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
   overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
   work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--
   and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
   Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
   cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=6b-8g5ZIHEcOAstO5H80ywQ-4d0P6cR    Want to review Cartoon Editor? Submit your opinion here:

   data, meaning that you can calculate the appropriate moon
   phase for a particular date and identify topographical

Date: 2002-10-08T20:52:08-05:00Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"". - Download MT 2.5[3].

"" but he added that the court couldn ' t assume the committee would divulge the confidential documents and enron ' s constitutional rights weren ' t "" jeopardized by delivery of their secrets to the document depository . "" on the other motion , to quash the subpoena , the judge found the committee did follow proper procedure when serving enron officials . attorneys for the committee and enron will return to court thursday on the tentative rulings . kobayashi set a court date for sept . 7 on the third motion , which is a request for an injunction of the committee ' s investigation and contempt proceedings . enron officials didn ' t immediately return calls from the associated press seeking comment . enron officials have said the company is prepared to turn over 25 , 000 documents that were already in california , but that other documents the committee wants are in texas and out of the panel ' s reach . the committee found enron in contempt for not turning over the documents . a full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full senate , which has not voted on it . a contempt report on reliant energy has also been sent to the senate . a contempt finding against mirant corp . was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in sacramento for the committee ' s investigators . if the full senate imposes sanctions against reliant or enron , it will be the first time since 1929 , when the senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations involving cement sales to the state . folder name : rahil jafry relevance score on scale of 100 : 83 to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

6303,"politeness theory call for papers politeness theory and language in the mass media this is a call for papers that explore linguistic politeness and social interaction in the mass media . in the introduction to the second edition of politeness , brown and levinson write , "" we believe we happen to have stumbled on an area where many orthogonal aspects of social life converge in a set of crucial preoccupations in social interaction . "" brown and levinson state that politeness is at the heart of those preoccupations . while there have been numerous studies of linguistic politeness since brown and levinson 's original paper , there has been little attention paid to politeness theory in discussions of language in the mass media . we believe that the mass media provide a unique yet ubiquitous arena through which to explore linguistic politeness because of the often ambiguous nature of social interaction in the mass media . it is our interest in the nature of social interaction in the mass media that provides the impetus for this book project . we also believe there is a need for theories of media discourse based on sociolinguistic perspectives . we are seeking original essays to include in a book volume that examines aspects of linguistic politeness based on data collected from the mass media . we would especially like to encourage submissions based on data from languages other than english . the intended audience of the book will be undergraduates , graduate students , and scholars in the areas of sociolinguistics , anthropological linguistics , linguistic pragmatics , ethnography of communication , sociology and communications . please forward an indication of interest and a one-page abstract of the proposed contribution by april 30 , 1998 to : prof . troi carleton 1200 holloway drive , department of english , san francisco state university , san francisco , ca 94132 , e-mail : troi @ sfsu . edu or prof . robin queen , english department , kent state university , kent , oh 44242-0001 , e-mail : rqueen @ kent . edu . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - robin m . queen english department kent state university kent , oh 44242-0001 tel : 330-672 - 2219",Safe Email

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM. Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful - I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

4425,"More than a dozen jokes - thanks guys and girls!
(plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect).Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it.
I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting,
both pratically and asymptotically.It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)),
or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation.  Before the best methods took
O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.
The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes
time O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding
some logarithmic factors.After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the
number of points on the curve.Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using
a 1 GHz Pentium III:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

additional complications for some of the other architectures.
(Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images
available gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the
public to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary
apps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in 
boxed set editions.)(1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE ""evaluation""

lack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/Please note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated
YaST program specifically, stated here:ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yastA grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole

     you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:   - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on

> probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD
official ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright
monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short
stories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent
stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing
those stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works
deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.
(A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have
held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of
alphabetical telephone listings in a ""yellow pages"" telephone directory
(the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative
content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation
copyright.  (The court politely said ""Nice try"", in effect.)The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.
Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different
set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation
copyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually 
charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody
wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs
or distribution as a whole.> I could be wrong, I don't use SuSE so haven't investigated,

more-or-less freely, as long as it's not ""for value"".  (Ditto the
""live-eval"" edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'
contents may not.--

--] Anyone heard of this law before?Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
up.If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write
some apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it

8126,"DEAR SIR,I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.Best personal regards,MRS MARIAM ABACHA.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--

All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first
journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of
the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly
from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.htmlToday's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,
since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this
journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top
researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
ideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many for
sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
technologies.Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the

exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.I hope this helps some.

This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe!

* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly.

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.)

universe. too big to decrypt.my point is there will never be a ""safe"" key. what I would consider is how
long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for
longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to
stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what
is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not
release the data to the public.I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking
the key gives away it's secret.the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP
for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the
nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we
needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the
XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my

7301,"sum : dets and number about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur in argument position , and may be interpreted as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as opposed to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiners are unmarked for number ( eg . english "" the "" , "" some "" , "" john 's "" , as opposed to "" this "" , "" these "" ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number , the resulting np * is * marked for number . so far , i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n't satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" kucing "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners "" itu "" ( that / the ) and ini "" ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . "" seekor kucing itu "" ( that / the one cat ) , "" dua ekor kucing itu "" ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with "" itu "" and ini "" tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . "" kucing itu "" ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . "" cat "" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as "" john 's "" are unmarked for number , eg . "" john 's one cat "" ( john 's one cat ) , "" john 's two cat ( s ) "" ( john 's two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . "" john 's cat "" ( john 's cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ? ( d ) does anybody have any ideas how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself . two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own revealed that in singlish , not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article "" the "" exhibits a similar singularity effect : although unmarked for number ( as evidenced by "" the one cat "" , "" the two cat ( s ) "" ) , "" the cat "" is interpreted as singular . ) further observations were provided by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn williams .",Safe Email

  |[ ... ]
  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
  | equally broken, rather than standing up and saying ""how about
  | we try & make everyone better"". eh?  POSIX doesn't ""do"" anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some ""POSIX-compatibility"", but that's a freely-made choice. IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider ""formal""
 submissions of ""proven"" technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.) OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above ""weakness"" is a strength ....  | (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck) yep.  which is not to say POSIX ""sucks"" per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple. however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between ""consider porting"" and ""actually porting"" --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
 others were Frustrating ""system"" incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,

4119,"enron mentions enron bonds subject to market jitters , not buyout talk capital markets report - 11 / 05 / 01 market views enron takeover rumors with skepticism dow jones news service - 11 / 05 / 01 no excuses for this enron board realmoney . com - 11 / 05 / 01 this market deserves your well - placed optimism realmoney . com - 11 / 05 / 01 enron bonds subject to market jitters , not buyout talk by michael c . barr of dow jones newswires 11 / 05 / 2001 capital markets report ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - reports over the weekend that embattled enron corp . ( ene ) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company ' s bonds monday . on sunday , the independent in london reported that royal dutch petroleum co . ( rd ) planned to mount an $ 11 billion offering for the company . and barron ' s stated that there was speculation that enron might attract takeover interest from either royal dutch or warren buffet ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka ) . enron ' s bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to treasury bond issues . a $ 74 bid and a $ 77 offer was quoted as the market for enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % bonds of 2003 monday morning , similar to friday ' s levels . "" the company ' s bonds were quoted in the low - to mid - 70 s on friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing , "" said wayne schmidt , portfolio manager , advantus capital management , st . paul , minn . "" market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds , "" said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . even an enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par , traders said . the 6 . 45 % coupon bond due on november 15 , 2001 , less than two weeks away , was bid at a dollar price of 99 . "" some investors don ' t want to own anything with a downside risk , "" said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin & co . , a distressed debt brokerage firm , princeton , n . j . the bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame , with little upside potential gain , he added . there is "" very little liquidity in the company ' s bonds , "" said rivkin . enron ' s bonds will follow the company ' s stock movements , he added . enron closed monday at $ 11 . 03 , down $ 0 . 27 from friday ' s close of $ 11 . 30 . enron officials weren ' t immediately available to comment . crisis of investor confidence the houston - based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month . and last wednesday , the company said that the securities and exchange commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow . the ratings agencies have reacted to the company ' s liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence . fitch downgraded enron ' s senior unsecured debt monday to triple - b - minus , from triple - b - plus . it ' s now just a notch away from junk bond status . last week , standard & poor ' s corp . lowered the credit rating to triple - b , while moody ' s investors service lowered the rating to baa 2 . shell may have interest , but royal dutch shell may have an interest in enron , say analysts . "" shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to expand in north america and latin america , "" said tina vital , equity analyst , standard 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . market views enron takeover rumors with skepticism by christina cheddar of dow jones newswires 11 / 05 / 2001 dow jones news service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - ( dow jones ) - with each day shedding light on new revelations about enron corp . ' s ( ene ) financial dealings , it is difficult to put odds on the company as a takeover target . but speculation has been persistent that royal dutch / shell group may use enron ' s weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover . over the weekend , the british newspaper , the independent , fanned the flames of speculation again by saying that shell was expected to offer $ 11 billion for the houston energy trader . a shell spokesman wasn ' t immediately available . surely , enron ' s thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a company such as the anglo - dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the u . s . natural gas market , where shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence . however , a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company ' s financial structure . enroll has used a web of off - balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs . some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off its balance sheet . several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such as shell would want to make an acquisition while a securities and exchange commission investigation is pending . as for enron ' s core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is enron ' s staff . as a result , it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile transactions . shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing and trading sector through its coral energy unit , and the acquisition of enron could give it instant clout in the market . also , shell ' s strong balance sheet would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness . traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it would be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation calmed and more details of enron ' s business are uncovered . a growth - fund manager , who requested anonymity , also said it is important to know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in enron ' s stock price . he speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock . enron shares recently traded at $ 11 . 14 , down 16 cents , or 1 . 4 % . the stock began the day in positive territory , and traded as high as $ 12 . 20 intraday . the stock has declined more than 60 % since the company in mid - october posted a third - quarter charge of more than $ 1 billion . the company also later disclosed an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andy fastow . in the weeks that followed the disclosure , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded by moody ' s investor service , standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones they are very smart and very wise to the ways of wall street , main street and the oil patch . norman blake is a gent i met years ago at usfg , before he sold it at a huge profit . this man has recently served as ceo of comdisco , a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing , it is wallowing in it . blake has general electric training . this man can smell things that are not so right from miles away . where was he in all of this ? stuck in comdisco hell ? ronnie chan is a longtime kingpin in hong kong , a place where financial originality is always on display . chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared . he ' s seen everything over in kong . john duncan is an energy investment guy , a director of eott energy , and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting . again , very sophisticated . wendy gramm regulated derivatives . she was the chairman of the cftc and a director of the chicago mercantile exchange . how could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed ? that was part of her old job . robert jaedicke was a professor of accounting at stanford business school , where he was also dean . this guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming . ( i am skipping ken lay , the ceo . ) charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn , two execs from the university of texas m . d . anderson cancer center , can ' t be expected to catch this stuff , and therefore gets a pass from me . paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro . that ' s probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations . how could he not raise a word about it ? frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international , perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management . i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enron ' s looking through his own company ' s portfolio of investments . jeffrey skilling , the man who resigned as ceo , needs to be heard from . we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas , a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don ' t get hold . what did he know and when did he know it ? john wakeham , lord wakeham to everybody , is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament . he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant . he ' s big and powerful and smart . herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central , a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations . in short , this is the most sophisticated , hands - on group of folks i have come across . i can ' t believe they checked off on this stuff . i have to believe they didn ' t know , or if they knew of the partnerships , i believe they had no idea what they were doing . i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enron ' s credit rating with the agencies - - not that that ' s such an ethical setup . but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant , as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were . still , let ' s not fool ourselves . this was a powerhouse , fantastic , upright board of people who know a thing or two . i can ' t believe they let this stuff occur . i think they knew nothing . which is pretty terrible in its own right . this market deserves your well - placed optimism by james j . cramer > realmoney . com 11 / 05 / 2001 10 : 32 am est url : > d ? j ? vu circa 1991 . that ' s what i keep thinking about . i recall that time vividly . bank of boston , chase , chemical , citibank , they all started rallying . we bears would call each other and joke about it . we would say that it was a ridiculous move , that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively , because there was no way that any of these banks would make it . heck , bank of boston was teetering on insolvency . citibank was technically bankrupt already . the jim grants of the world ( more powerful now than they were then because he didn ' t have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt ) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying . i would call the analysts , and they wouldn ' t know anything either - - the ones who liked the banks all the way down , who still liked them and who had no credibility at all . the ones who hated them didn ' t want to get off the winning horses . they didn ' t know that the race was over and that a new one had begun . or , to put it the brutal way that i now know was right : no one with a brain was long any of these . turns out , of course , that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom . what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism , because at certain points in history optimists get it right . that ' s how i feel about this market . i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred . i think we will look back at this period and say the following : the great bear market started in march 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until sept . 11 , the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around . most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come . they were wrong , just like they were in 1991 . we get so caught up in the "" is cisco bottoming ? "" or "" is intel breaking out ? "" minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now , pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago . you would think that we ' d have converted more bears to bulls by now , but like in 1991 , it didn ' t happen until well into the turn . don ' t confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities . i think that , for example , xo communications is going to fail , and when it does , there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech . i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same . there are a ton of companies that won ' t get through this period , just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991 . and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks . i can ' t get my arms around how ford comes back ; i don ' t understand the enron fiasco at all . i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding . but that doesn ' t make me bearish . understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature . had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991 , had i not personally been "" bought in "" on a half - dozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from super - regionals not long after i , too , would be suspicious and want to bet against the market . i can ' t , though , because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i don ' t want to get burned by again . believe me , i am a cold - blooded individual about these things . if i thought the short side was the right side here , i would be all over it . we have had a huge bounce off the bottom ; there would be nothing "" unpatriotic "" about saying "" get out now . "" but i don ' t think that ' s right . i think this market ' s going to keep working here . if it doesn ' t , people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me , and i will say , c ' est la vie , i took a stand ; it was wrong . taking stands , however , is what it is all about . knowing your context and making money with that context is what i do and have done for 20 years . if you don ' t have a context , if you don ' t have a view , there ' s only one thing to do : give your money to others who do . random musings : glenn curtis ' s era of value newsletter has been making me money . when something makes me money i talk about it . check it out here . curtis and gary b . smith both are doing some terrific things . understand , i get all of the newsletters out there . i see the hype that a navallier or a murphy puts out and i want to puke . this stuff is nothing like that , nothing at all . it is honest , candid and doesn ' t guarantee that you will shoot the lights out , like those who you know can ' t . . . on my radio show , it ' s mutual fund monday , where we will fix your 401 ( k ) ) . call me at 1 - 800 - 862 - 8686 from 3 p . m . to 4 p . m . et .",Safe Email

I actually like Neale's X-Spam-Disposition header, I just wonder if maybe we
should choose something with a different prefix than ""X-Spam-"" so that
people don't confuse it with SpamAssassin, all of whose headers begin with
that prefix.Also, some sort of version information would be useful.  Perhaps the CVS

This'll put it in that particular order for ya.  You can also chose to order it by name, etc by changing this field.

Dear readers,If the majority of your photos are posed snapshots and
landscapes, a fast camera may not matter. But if you've ever
missed a shot because your camera was busy processing the
previous photo, the Leica Digilux 1 will appeal to you. We liked
it too, and we gave it an Editors' Choice award.Leica Digilux 1: Legendary charm Â 
The legendary German lens maker takes aim at digital-era
  street photographers with the Digilux 1. A combination of
  speed, manual control, and advanced features helps this
  4-megapixel camera provide a digital option to shutterbugs
  with an eye for the decisive moment.
